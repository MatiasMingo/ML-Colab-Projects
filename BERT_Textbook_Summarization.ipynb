A thorough understanding of equity securities will be \\nnecessary in order to successfully complete the Series 65 exam. Equity \\nsecurities are divided into two types: common and preferred stock. We \\nwill examine the features of common stock and preferred stock, as well \\nas the bene˜ts and risks associated with their ownership, but ˜rst we \\nmust de˜ne exactly what meets the de˜nition of a security.\\nWHAT IS A SECURITY?\\nA security is any investment product that can be exchanged for value and \\ninvolves risk. In order for an investment to be considered a security, it must \\nbe readily transferable between two parties and the owner must be subject to \\nthe loss of some, or all, of the invested principal. If the product is not trans\\n-\\nferable or does not contain risk, it is not a security.\\nTypes of Securities\\nTypes of Nonsecurities\\nCommon stock\\nWhole life insurance\\nPreferred stock\\nTerm life insurance \\nBonds\\nIRAs\\nMutual funds\\n \\nRetirement plans \\n(\\nContinued\\n)\\n', '2\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTypes of Securities\\nTypes of Nonsecurities\\nVariable annuities\\n \\nFixed annuities \\nVariable life insurance\\n \\nProspectus\\nOptions\\nCon˜rmations \\nRights\\nWarrants\\nETFs/ETNs\\nReal estate investment trusts\\nCMOs\\nEQUITY \\n˜\\n STOCK\\n˜e term equity is synonymous with the term stock. ˜roughout your prepa\\n-\\nration for this exam and on the exam itself, you will ˚nd many terms that are \\nused interchangeably. Equity or stock creates an ownership relationship with \\nthe issuing company. Once an investor has purchased stock in a corporation, \\nthey become an owner of that corporation. ˜e corporation sells o˛ pieces of \\nitself to investors in the form of shares in an e˛ort to raise working capital. \\nEquity is perpetual, meaning there is no maturity date for the shares and the \\ninvestor may own the shares until they decide to sell them. Most corporations \\nuse the sale of equity as their main source of business capital.\\nCOMMON STOCK\\n˜ere are thousands of companies whose stock trades publicly and who have \\nused the sale of equity as a source of raising business capital. All publicly traded \\ncompanies must issue common stock before they may issue any other type of \\nequity security. ˜ere are two types of equity securities: common stock and \\npreferred stock. While all publicly traded companies must have sold or issued \\ncommon stock, not all companies may want to issue or sell preferred stock. \\nLet™s take a look at the creation of a company and how common stock is created.\\nCORPORATE TIME LINE\\n˜e following is a representation of the steps that corporations must take in \\norder to sell their common stock to the public, as well as what may happen \\nto that stock once it has been sold to the public.\\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n3\\nAUTHORIZED STOCK\\nAuthorized stock is the maximum number of shares that a company may sell \\nto the investing public in an e˛ort to raise cash to meet the organization™s \\ngoals. ˜e number of authorized shares is arbitrarily determined and is set at \\nthe time of incorporation. A corporation may sell all or part of its authorized \\nstock. If the corporation wants to sell more shares than it™s authorized to sell, \\nthe shareholders must approve an increase in the number of authorized shares.\\nISSUED STOCK\\nIssued stock is stock that has been authorized for sale and that has actually \\nbeen sold to the investing public. ˜e total number of authorized shares typi\\n-\\ncally exceeds the total number of issued shares so that the corporation may \\nsell additional shares in the future to meet its needs. Once shares have been \\nsold to the investing public, they will always be counted as issued shares, \\nregardless of their ownership or subsequent repurchase by the corporation. \\nIt™s important to note that the total number of issued shares may never exceed \\nthe total number of authorized shares.\\nAdditional authorized shares may be issued in the future for any of the \\nfollowing reasons:\\n\\n \\nP\\nay a stock dividend\\n\\n \\nE\\nxpand current operations\\n\\n \\nE\\nxchange common shares for convertible preferred or convertible bonds\\n\\n \\nT\\no satisfy obligations under employee stock options or purchase plans\\nOUTSTANDING STOCK\\nOutstanding stock is stock that has been sold or issued to the investing public \\nand that actually remains in the hands of the investing public.\\nEXAMPLE:\\n \\nXYZ corporation has 10,000,000 shares authorized and has sold 5,000,000 \\nshares to the public during its initial public o˛ering. In this case, there would \\nbe 5,000,000 shares of stock issued and 5,000,000 shares outstanding.\\nTREASURY STOCK\\nTreasury stock is stock that has been sold to the investing public, which has \\nsubsequently been repurchased by the corporation. ˜e corporation may elect \\n', '4\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nto reissue the shares or it may retire the shares that it holds in treasury stock. \\nTreasury stock does not receive dividends, nor does it vote.\\nA corporation may elect to repurchase its own shares for any of the fol\\n-\\nlowing reasons:\\n\\n \\nT\\no maintain control of the company\\n\\n \\nT\\no increase earnings per share\\n\\n \\nT\\no fund employee stock purchase plans\\n\\n \\nT\\no use shares to pay for a merger or acquisition\\nTo determine the amount of treasury stock, use the following formula:\\nIssued stock Œ outstanding stock \\n˜\\n treasury stock\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf, in the case of XYZ, the company decides to repurchase 3,000,000 of its \\nown shares then XYZ would have 5,000,000 shares issued, 2,000,000 shares, \\nand 3,000,000 shares of treasury stock.\\nIt™s important to note that once the shares have been issued, they will \\nalways be counted as issued shares. ˜e only thing that changes is the number \\nof outstanding shares and the number of treasury shares.\\nVALUES OF COMMON STOCK\\nA common stock™s market value is determined by supply and demand and \\nmay or may not have any real relationship to what the shares are actually \\nworth. ˜e market value of common stock is a˛ected by the current and \\nfuture expectations for the company.\\nBOOK VALUE\\nA corporation™s book value is the theoretical liquidation value of the com\\n-\\npany. ˜e book value is found by taking all of the company™s tangible assets \\nand subtracting all of its liabilities. ˜is will give you the total book value. \\nTo determine the book values per share, divide the total book value by the \\ntotal number of outstanding common shares.\\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n5\\nPAR VALUE\\nPar value, in a discussion regarding common stock, is only important if you \\nare an accountant looking at the balance sheet. An accountant uses the par \\nvalue as a way to credit the money received by the corporation from the initial \\nsale of the stock to the balance sheet. For investors, it has no relationship to \\nany measure of value, which may otherwise be employed.\\nRIGHTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\\nAs an owner of common stock, investors are owners of the corporation. As \\nsuch, investors have certain rights that are granted to all common stock \\nholders.\\nPREEMPTIVE RIGHTS\\nAs a stockholder, an investor has the right to maintain their percentage inter\\n-\\nest in the company. ˜is is known as a preemptive right. Should the company \\nwish to sell additional shares to raise new capital, they must ˚rst o˛er the \\nnew shares to existing shareholders. If the existing shareholders decide not \\nto purchase the new shares, then the shares may be o˛ered to the general \\npublic. When a corporation decides to conduct a rights o˛ering, the board of \\ndirectors must approve the issuance of the additional shares. If the number \\nof shares that are to be issued under the rights o˛ering would cause the total \\nnumber of outstanding shares to exceed the total number of authorized shares, \\nthen shareholder approval will be required. Existing shareholders will have \\nto approve an increase in the number of authorized shares before the rights \\no˛ering can proceed.\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nNumber of \\nExisting Shares\\nNumber of New  \\nShares\\nTotal Shares \\nAfter O˜ering\\n100,000\\n100,000\\n200,000\\n10,000\\n10% ownership\\n10,000\\n10% of o˚ering\\n20,000\\n10% ownership\\n', '6\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nIn this example, the company has 100,000 shares of stock outstanding and \\nan investor has purchased 10,000 of those original shares. As a result, they \\nown 10% of the corporation. The company wishing to sell 100,000 new \\nshares to raise new capital must ˜rst o˚er 10% of the new shares to the \\ncurrent investor (10,000 shares) before the shares may be o˚ered to the \\ngeneral public. So if the investor decides to purchase the additional shares, \\nas is the case in the example, the investor will have maintained his or her \\n10% interest in the company.\\nA shareholder™s preemptive right is ensured through a rights o˚ering. \\nThe existing shareholders will have the right to purchase the new shares \\nat a discount to the current market value for up to 45 days. This is known \\nas the subscription price. Once the subscription price is set, it remains con-\\nstant for the 45 days, while the price of the stock is moving up and down \\nin the market place.\\n˜ere are three possible outcomes for a right. ˜ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nE\\nxercised:\\n ˜e investor decides to purchase the additional shares and \\nsends in the money, along with the rights to receive the additional shares.\\n2.\\n \\nS\\nold:\\n ˜e rights have value and if the investor does not want to purchase \\nthe additional shares, they may be sold to another investor who would \\nlike to purchase the shares.\\n3.\\n \\nE\\nxpire:\\n ˜e rights will expire when no one wants to purchase the stock. \\n˜is will only occur when the market price of the share has fallen below \\nthe subscription price of the right and the 45 days has elapsed.\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF A RIGHTS OFFERING\\nOnce a rights o˛ering has been declared, the company™s common stock will \\ntrade with the rights attached. ˜e stock in this situation is said to be trading \\ncum rights. ˜e company™s stock, which is the subject of the rights o˛ering, \\nwill trade cum rights between the declaration date and the ex date. A˝er the \\nex date, the stock will trade without the rights attached or will trade ex rights. \\n˜e value of the common stock will be adjusted down by the value of the right \\non the ex-rights date. During a rights o˛ering, each share will be issued one \\nright. ˜e subscription price and the number of rights required to purchase \\none additional share will be detailed in the terms of the o˛ering on the rights \\ncerti˚cate. During a rights o˛ering, the issuer will retain an investment bank \\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n7\\nto act as a standby underwriter and the investment bank will stand by, ready \\nto purchase any shares that are not purchased by the rights holders.\\nDETERMINING THE VALUE OF A RIGHT CUM RIGHTS\\nIn order to determine the value of one right before the ex-rights date, you must \\nuse the cum-rights formula. Subtract the subscription price of the right from \\nthe market price of the stock. Once the discount (if any) has been determined, \\ndivide the discount by the number of rights required to purchase one share \\nplus one. ˜is will determine the value of one right.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nXYZ has 10,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding and is issuing \\n5,000,000 additional common shares through a rights o˛ering. XYZ is trading \\nin the marketplace at $51 per share and the rights have a subscription price \\nof $48 per share.

You are a part owner of the company and, as a result, you \\nhave a right to say how the company is run. ˜e biggest emphasis is placed \\non the election of the board of directors.\\nCommon stockholders may also vote on:\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuance of bonds or additional common shares\\n\\n \\nS\\ntock splits\\n\\n \\nM\\nergers and acquisitions\\n\\n \\nM\\najor changes in corporate policy\\nMETHODS OF VOTING\\n˜ere are two methods by which the voting process may be conducted: statu\\n-\\ntory and cumulative.

The cumulative method is said \\nto favor smaller investors for this reason.\\nLIMITED LIABILITY\\nA stockholder™s liability is limited to the amount of money invested in the \\nstock. ˜ey cannot be held liable for any amount past their invested capital.\\nFREELY TRANSFERABLE\\nCommon stock and most other securities are freely transferable. ˜at is to say \\nthat one investor may sell their shares to another investor without limitation \\nand without requiring the approval of the issuer. ˜e transfer of a security™s \\nownership, in most cases, is facilitated through a broker dealer. ˜e transfer \\n', '10\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nof ownership is executed in the secondary market on either an exchange or \\nin the over-the-counter market.

In the case of a bond issue, the registrar will \\ncertify that the bond is a legally binding debt of the company. ˜e function of \\nthe transfer agent and the registrar may not be performed by a single depart\\n-\\nment of any one company.

Stockholders also have the right to obtain a \\nlist of shareholders, but they do not have the right to review other corporate \\n˚nancial data that the corporation may deem con˚dential.\\nRESIDUAL CLAIM TO ASSETS\\nIn the event of a company™s bankruptcy or liquidation, common stockholders \\nhave the right to receive their proportional interest in residual assets. A˝er \\nall the other security holders have been paid (along with all creditors of the \\ncorporation), common stockholders may claim the residual assets. For this \\nreason, common stock is the most junior security.\\nWHY DO PEOPLE BUY COMMON STOCK?\\n˜e main reason people invest in common stock is for capital appreciation. \\n˜ey want their money to grow in value over time. An investor in common \\nstock hopes to buy the stock at a low price and sell it at a higher price at some \\npoint in the future.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor purchases 100 shares of XYZ at $20 per share on March 15, 2014. \\nOn April 20 of 2015\\n, the investor sells 100 shares of XYZ for $30 per share, \\nrealizing a pro˚t of $10 per share or $1,000 on the 100 shares.\\nINCOME\\nMany corporations distribute a portion of their earnings to their investors in \\nthe form of dividends. ˜is distribution of earnings creates income for the \\ninvestor, and investors in common stock generally receive dividends quarterly. \\n', '12\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n˜e amount of income that an investor receives each year is measured rela\\n-\\ntive to what the investor has paidŠor will payŠfor the stock and is known \\nas the dividend yield or the current yield.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nABC pays a $.50 quarterly dividend to its shareholders. ˜e stock is currently \\ntrading at $20 per share.

So long \\nas the corporation pays a dividend the investor will have more shares of the \\ncompany at the end of each year.\\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF OWNING COMMON STOCK?\\n˜e major risk in owning common stock is that the stock may fall in value. \\n˜ere are no sure things in the stock market and, even if you own stock in a \\ngreat company, you may end up losing money.\\nDIVIDENDS MAY BE STOPPED OR REDUCED\\nCommon stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends just because they \\nown part of the company. It is up to the company to elect to pay a dividend. ˜e \\ncorporation is in no way obligated to pay a dividend to common shareholders.\\nJUNIOR CLAIM ON CORPORATE ASSETS\\nA common stockholder is the last person to get paid if the company is liqui\\n-\\ndated. It is very possible that a˝er all creditors and other investors are paid, \\nthere will be little or nothing le˝ for the common stockholder.\\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n13\\nHOW DOES SOMEONE BECOME A STOCKHOLDER?\\nWe have reviewed some of the reasons why an investor would want to become \\na stockholder. Now we need to review how someone becomes a stockholder. \\nAlthough some people purchase the shares directly from the corporation \\nwhen the stock is o˛ered to the public directly, most investors purchase the \\nshares from other investors. ˜ese investor-to-investor transactions take \\nplace in the secondary market on the exchange or in the over-the-counter \\nmarket. Although the transaction in many cases only take seconds to execute, \\ntrades actually take several days to fully complete. Let™s review the important \\ndates regarding transactions, which are done for a ﬁregular-wayﬂ settlement.\\nTRADE DATE\\n˜e trade date is the day when your order is actually executed. Although an \\norder has been placed with a broker, it may not be executed on the same day. \\n˜ere are certain types of orders that may take several days or even longer \\nto execute, depending on the type of order. A market order will be executed \\nimmediately (as soon as it is presented to the market), making the trade date \\nthe same day the order was entered.\\nSETTLEMENT DATE\\n˜e buyer of a security actually becomes the owner of record on the settle\\n-\\nment date. When an investor buys a security from another investor, the \\nselling investor™s name is removed from the security and the buyer™s name is \\nrecorded as the new owner. Settlement date is three business days a˝er the \\ntrade date. ˜is is known as T\\n˛\\n3 for all regular-way transactions in common \\nstock, preferred stock, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. Government \\nbonds and options all settle the next business day following the trade date.\\nPAYMENT DATE\\n˜e payment date is the day when the buyer of the security has to have the \\nmoney in to the brokerage ˚rm to pay for the purchase. Under industry \\nrules, the payment date for common and preferred stock and corporate and \\nmunicipal bonds is ˚ve business days a˝er the trade date or T\\n˛\\n5. Payment \\ndates are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board under Regulation T of the \\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Although many brokerage ˚rms require \\ntheir customers to have their money in to pay for their purchases sooner than \\nthe rules state, the customer has up to ˚ve business days to pay for the trade.\\n', '14\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nVIOLATION\\nIf the customer fails to pay for the purchase within the ˚ve business days \\nallowed, the customer is in violation of Regulation T. As a result, the brokerage \\n˚rm will ﬁsell outﬂ and freeze the customer™s account. On the sixth business \\nday following the trade date, the brokerage ˚rm will sell out the securities \\nfor which the customer failed to pay. ˜e customer is responsible for any loss \\nthat may occur as a result of the sell out and the brokerage ˚rm may sell out \\nshares of another security in the investor™s account in order to cover the loss. \\n˜e brokerage ˚rm then will freeze the customer™s account, which means \\nthat the customer must deposit money up front for any purchases they want \\nto make in the next 90 days. A˝er the 90 days have expired, the customer is \\nconsidered to have reestablished good credit and then may conduct business \\nin the regular way and take up to ˚ve business days to pay for their trades.\\nPREFERRED STOCK\\nPreferred stock is an equity security with a ˚xed income component. Like \\na common stockholder, the preferred stockholder is an owner of the com\\n-\\npany. However the preferred stockholder is investing in the stock for the \\n˚xed income that the preferred shares generate through their semiannual \\ndividends. Preferred stock has a stated dividend rate or a ˚xed rate that the \\ncorporation must pay to its preferred shareholders. Growth is generally not \\nachieved through investing in preferred shares.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nWhile not the norm, some companies issue adjustable rate preferred shares. \\nThe dividend rate on these shares will be adjusted based on a benchmark \\nsuch as Treasury bill rates. Because the dividend rate adjusts with market \\ninterest rates the price of the shares tends to be stable.\\nFEATURES OF ALL PREFERRED STOCK\\n˜ere are a number of di˛erent types of preferred stock but all preferred stock \\nhave the same basic features.\\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n15\\nPAR VALUE\\nPar value on preferred stock is very important because that™s what the divi\\n-\\ndend is based on. Par value for all preferred shares is $100 unless otherwise \\nstated. Companies generally express the dividend as a percentage of par value \\nfor preferred stock.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nHow much would the following investor receive in annual income from the \\ninvestment in the following preferred stock?\\nAn investor buys 100 shares of TWT 9% preferred.\\n$100\\n˝\\n˙\\n˝\\n9% \\n˜\\n $9 per share\\n˝\\n˙\\n˝\\n100 \\n˜\\n $900\\nPAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\\n˜e dividend on preferred shares must be paid before any dividends are paid \\nto common shareholders. ˜is gives the preferred shareholder a priority claim \\non the corporation™s distribution of earnings.\\nDISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS\\nIf a corporation liquidates or declares bankruptcy, the preferred shareholders \\nare paid prior to any common shareholder, giving the preferred shareholder \\na higher claim on the corporation™s assets.\\nPERPETUAL\\nPreferred stock, unlike bonds, is perpetual with no maturity date. Investors \\nmay hold shares for as long as they wish or until the shares are called in by \\nthe company under a call feature.\\nNONVOTING\\nMost preferred stock is nonvoting. Occasionally the holder of a cumulative \\npreferred stock may receive voting rights in the event the corporation misses \\nseveral dividend payments.\\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVE\\nBecause of the ˚xed income generated by preferred shares, their price will \\nbe more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the price of their common \\nstock counterparts. As interest rates decline, the value of preferred shares \\ntends to increase and when interest rates rise, the value of the preferred shares \\ntends to fall. ˜is is known as an inverse relationship.\\n', '16\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTYPES OF PREFERRED STOCK\\nPreferred stock, unlike common stock, may have di˛erent features associated \\nwith it. Most of the features are designed to make the issue more attractive \\nto investors and, therefore, bene˚t the owners of preferred stock.\\nSTRAIGHT/NONCUMULATIVE\\n˜e straight preferred stock has no additional features. ˜e holder is entitled \\nto the stated dividend rate and nothing else. If the corporation is unable to \\npay the dividend, it is not owed to the investor.\\nCUMULATIVE PREFERRED\\nA cumulative feature protects the investor in cases when a corporation is \\nhaving ˚nancial diˆculties and cannot pay the dividend. Dividends on cumu\\n-\\nlative preferred stock accumulate in arrears until the corporation is able to \\npay them. If the dividend on a cumulative preferred stock is missed, it is still \\nowed to the holder. Dividends in arrears on cumulative issues are always the \\n˚rst dividends to be paid. If the company wants to pay a dividend to common \\nshareholders, they must ˚rst pay the dividends in arrears, as well as the stated \\npreferred dividend, before common holders receive anything.\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nGNR has an 8% cumulative preferred stock outstanding. It has not paid \\nthe dividend this year or for the prior three years. How much must the \\nholders of GNR cumulative preferred be paid per share before the common \\nstockholders are paid a dividend?\\nThe dividend has not been paid this year nor for the previous three \\nyears, so the holders are owed four years™ worth of dividends or:\\n4 \\n˙\\n $8 \\n˜\\n $32 per share\\nPARTICIPATING PREFERRED\\nHolders of participating preferred stock are entitled to receive the stated \\npreferred rate as well as additional common dividends. ˜e holder of partici\\n-\\npating preferred receives the dividend payable to the common stockholders \\nover and above the stated preferred dividend.\\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n17\\nCONVERTIBLE PREFERRED\\nA convertible feature allows the preferred stockholder to convert or exchange \\ntheir preferred shares for common shares at a ˚xed price known as the con\\n-\\nversion price.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nTRW has issued a 4% convertible preferred stock, which may be converted \\ninto TRW common stock at $20 per share. How many shares may the preferred \\nstockholder receive upon conversion?\\nNumber of shares \\n˜\\n par/conversion price (CVP)\\n$100/$20 \\n˜\\n 5\\n˜e investor may receive ˚ve common shares for every preferred share.\\n˜ese are some additional concepts regarding convertible securities that \\nwill be addressed in the convertible bond section that follows.\\nCALLABLE PREFERRED\\nA call feature is the only feature that bene˚ts the company and not the inves\\n-\\ntor. A call feature allows the corporation to call in or redeem the preferred \\nshares at their discretion or a˝er some period of time has expired. Most call\\n-\\nable preferred stock may not be called in during the ˚rst few years a˝er its \\nissuance. ˜is feature, which does not allow the stock to be called in its early \\nyears, is known as call protection. Many callable preferred shares will be called \\nat a premium price above par. For example, a $100 par preferred stock may be \\ncalled at $103. ˜e main reasons a company would call in their preferred shares \\nwould be to eliminate the ˚xed dividend payment or to sell a new preferred \\nstock with a lower dividend rate when interest rates decline. Preferred stock is \\nmore likely to be called by the corporation when interest rates decline.\\nTYPES OF DIVIDENDS\\n˜ere are a number of ways in which a corporation may pay a dividend to its \\nshareholders. ˜e type of dividend declared for payment may vary between \\ncorporation and economic circumstances.\\nCASH\\nA cash dividend is the most common form of dividend and it is one that the \\ntest focuses on. A corporation will send out a cash payment (in the form of \\n', '18\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\na check) directly to the stockholders. For those stockholders who have their \\nstock held in the name of the brokerage ˚rm, a check will be sent to the bro\\n-\\nkerage ˚rm and the money will be credited to the investors account. Securi\\n-\\nties held in the name of the brokerage ˚rm are said to be held in street name. \\nTo determine the amount that an investor will receive, simply multiply the \\namount of the dividend to be paid by the number of shares.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nJPF pays a $.10 dividend to shareholders. An investor who owns 1,000 shares \\nof JPF will receive $100.\\n1,000 shares\\n˝\\n˙\\n˝\\n$.10 \\n˜\\n $100\\nSTOCK\\nA corporation that wants to reward its shareholdersŠbut also wants to con\\n-\\nserve cash for other business purposesŠmay elect to pay a stock dividend to \\ntheir shareholders. Each investor will receive an additional number of shares \\nbased on the number of shares that they own. ˜e market price of the stock \\nwill decline a˝er the stock dividend has been distributed to re˙ect the fact \\nthat there are now more shares outstanding, but the total market value of the \\ncompany will remain the same.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf HRT pays a 5% stock dividend to its shareholders, an investor with 500 \\nshares will receive an additional 25 shares. ˜is is determined by multiplying \\nthe number of shares owned by the amount of the stock dividend to be paid.\\n500\\n˝\\n˙\\n˝\\n5% \\n˜\\n 25\\nPROPERTY/PRODUCT\\n˜is is the least likely way in which a corporation would pay a dividend, but \\nit is a permissible dividend distribution. A corporation may send out to its \\nshareholders samples of its products or portions of its property.\\nDIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION\\nIf a corporation decides to pay a dividend to its common stockholders, they \\nmay not discriminate as to who receives the dividend. ˜e dividend must be \\npaid to all common stockholders of record. An investor who already owns \\nthe stock does not need to notify the company that they are entitled to receive \\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n19\\nthe pending dividend, because it will be sent to them automatically. However, \\nnew purchasers of the stock may or may not be entitled to receive the dividend \\ndepending on when they purchased the stock relative to when the dividend is \\ngoing to be distributed. We will now examine the dividend distribution process.\\nDECLARATION DATE\\n˜e declaration date is the day that the board of directors decides to pay \\na dividend to common stockholders of record. ˜e declaration date is the \\nstarting point for the entire dividend process. ˜e company must notify the \\nregulators at the exchange or FINRA (depending where the stock trades) at \\nleast 10 business days prior to the record date.\\nEX-DIVIDEND DATE\\n˜e ex-dividend date or the ex date is the ˚rst day when purchasers of the \\nsecurity are no longer entitled to receive the dividend that the company has \\ndeclared for payment. Stated another way, the ex date is the ˚rst day when the \\nstock trades without (ex) the dividend attached. ˜e exchange or FINRA set \\nthe ex date for the stock, based on the record date determined and announced \\nby the corporation™s board of directors. Because it takes three business days for \\na trade to settle, the ex date is always two business days prior to the record date.\\nRECORD DATE\\n˜is is the day when investors must have their name recorded on the stock \\ncerti˚cate in order to be entitled to receive the dividend that was declared by \\nthe board of directors. All stockholders whose name is on the stock certi˚cate \\n(owners of record) will be entitled to receive the dividend. ˜e investor would \\nhave had to have purchased the stock before the ex-dividend date in order to \\nbe an owner of record on the record date. ˜e record date is determined by \\nthe corporation™s board of directors and is used to determine the shareholders \\nthat will receive the dividend.\\nPAYMENT DATE\\n˜is is the day when the corporation actually distributes the dividend to \\nshareholders and it completes the dividend process. ˜e payment date is \\ncontrolled and set by the board of directors of the corporation and is usually \\nfour weeks following the record date.\\n', '20\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSTOCK PRICE AND THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE\\nIt is important to note that the value of the stock prior to the ex-dividend date \\nre˙ects the value of the stock with the dividend. On the ex-dividend date, \\nthe stock is now trading without the dividend attached and new purchasers \\nwill not receive the dividend that had been declared for payment. As a result \\nof this, the stock price will be adjusted down on the ex-dividend date in an \\namount equal to the dividend.\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nTRY declares a $.20 dividend payable to shareholders of record as of \\nThursday, August \\n22. The ex\\n-\\nd\\nividend date will be two business days prior \\nto the record date. In this case, the ex date will be Tuesday, August 20. If \\nTRY closed on Monday, August 19,\\n \\nat $24 \\nper share, the stock would open \\nat $23.80 on Tuesday.\\nSunday\\nMonday\\nTuesday\\nWednesday\\nThursday\\nFriday\\nSaturday\\n123\\n4567\\n89\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\nTAXATION OF DIVIDENDS\\nAll quali˚ed dividends received by investors are taxed at a rate of 15% for \\nordinary income earners and at a set rate of 20% for high-income earners. \\n \\nA key to determine which rate applies will be the investor™s marginal tax rate. \\nIf a question asks you about an investor who is in a high tax bracket such as \\n \\n39% the 20% rate will apply for the year the dividend is received. ˜e tax rate \\nfor dividends is a hotly debated topic and may be subject to change.\\nSELLING DIVIDENDS\\nSelling dividends is a violation! An investment adviser may not use the pend\\n-\\ning dividend payment as the sole basis of their recommendation to purchase \\n', 'CHAPTER 1\\n \\nE\\nquity Securities\\n \\n21\\nthe stock. Additionally, using the pending dividend as a means to create \\nurgency on the part of the investor to purchase the stock is a prime example \\nof this type of violation. If the investor were to purchase the shares just prior \\nto the ex-dividend date simply to receive the dividend, the investor in many \\ncases would end up worse o˛. ˜e dividend in this case would actually be a \\nreturn of the money that the investor used to purchase the stock and then the \\ninvestor would have a tax liability when they receive the dividend.\\nDIVIDEND DISBURSEMENT PROCESS\\nThe corporation™s dividend disbursement agent is responsible for the \\ndistribution of dividends and will send the dividends to the sharehold\\n-\\ners of record on the record date. For convenience, most investors have \\ntheir securities held in the name of the broker dealer, also known as \\nstreet name. As a result, the dividend disbursement agent will send the \\ndividends directly to the broker dealer. The broker dealer™s dividend \\ndepartment will collect the dividends and distribute them to the benefi\\n-\\ncial owners.\\nWARRANTS\\nA warrant is a security that gives the holder the opportunity to purchase \\ncommon stock. Like a right, the warrant has a subscription price.

An ADR is a receipt that represents the ownership \\nof the foreign shares that are being held abroad in a branch of a U.S. \\nbank. Each ADR represents ownership of between one to 10 shares of the \\nforeign stock and the holder of the ADR may request the delivery of the \\nforeign shares.

Corporations and municipalities, along with the U.S. government \\nand U.S. government agencies, all issue bonds in order to meet their \\ncapital needs. A bond represents a loan to the issuer in exchange for its \\npromise to repay the face amount of the bond known as the principal \\namount at maturity. On most bonds, the investor receives semiannual \\ninterest payments during the bond™s term. These semiannual interest \\npayments, along with any capital appreciation or depreciation at \\nmaturity, represent the investor™s return. A bondholder invests primarily \\nfor the interest income that will be generated during the bonds term.\\nCORPORATE BONDS\\nCorporations will issue bonds in an e˜ort to raise working capital to build \\nand expand their business. Corporate bondholders are not owners of the \\ncorporation; they are creditors of the company. Corporate debt ˚nancing \\nis known as leverage ˚nancing because the company pays interest only on \\nthe loan until maturity. Bondholders do not have voting rights as long as \\nthe company pays the interest and principal payments in a timely fashion. \\nIf the company defaults, the bondholders may be able to use their position \\nas creditors to gain a voice in the company™s management. Bondholders will \\n', '36\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nalways be paid before preferred and common stockholders in the event of \\nliquidation. Interest income received by investors on corporate bonds is tax\\n-\\nable at all levels, federal, state, and local.\\nTYPES OF BOND ISSUANCE\\nBEARER BONDS\\nBonds that are issued in coupon or bearer form do not record the owner™s \\ninformation with the issuer and the bond certi˚cate does not have the legal \\nowner™s name printed on it. As a result, anyone who possesses the bond is \\nentitled to receive the interest payments by clipping the coupons attached \\nto the bond and depositing them in a bank or trust company for payment. \\nAdditionally, the bearer is entitled to receive the principal payment at the \\nbond™s maturity. Bearer bonds are no longer issued within the United States; \\nhowever, they are still issued outside the country.\\nREGISTERED BONDS\\nMost bonds now are issued in registered form. Bonds that have been issued \\nin registered form have the owner™s name recorded on the books of the issuer \\nand the buyer™s name will appear on the bond certi˚cate.\\nPRINCIPAL-ONLY REGISTRATION\\nBonds that have been registered as to principal only have the owner™s name \\nprinted on the bond certi˚cate. ˛e issuer knows who owns the bond and \\nwho is entitled to receive the principal payment at maturity. However, the \\nbondholder will still be required to clip the coupons to receive the semian\\n-\\nnual interest payments.\\nFULLY REGISTERED\\nBonds that have been issued in fully registered form have the owner™s name \\nrecorded for both the interest and principal payments. ˛e owner is not required \\nto clip coupons and the issuer will send out the interest payments directly to \\nthe holder on a semiannual basis. ˛e issuer will also send the principal pay\\n-\\nment along with last semiannual interest payment directly to the owner at \\nmaturity. Most bonds in the United States are issued in fully registered form.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n37\\nBOOK ENTRY/JOURNAL ENTRY\\nBonds that have been issued in book entry or journal entry form have no \\nphysical certi˚cate issued to the holder as evidence of ownership. ˛e bonds \\nare fully registered and the issuer knows who is entitled to receive the semian\\n-\\nnual interest payments and the principal payment at maturity. ˛e investor™s \\nonly evidence of ownership is the trade con˚rmation, which is generated by \\nthe brokerage ˚rm, when the purchase order has been executed.\\nBOND CERTIFICATE\\nIf a bond certi˚cate is issued, it must include:\\n\\n \\nN\\name of issuer\\n\\n \\nP\\nrincipal amount\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuing date\\n\\n \\nM\\naturity date\\n\\n \\nI\\nnterest payment dates\\n\\n \\nP\\nlace where interest is payable (paying agent)\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of bond\\n\\n \\nI\\nnterest rate\\n\\n \\nC\\nall feature (if any or noncallable)\\n\\n \\nR\\neference to the trust indenture\\nBOND PRICING\\nOnce issued, corporate bonds trade in the secondary market between investors \\nsimilar to the way equity securities do. ˛e price of bonds in the secondary \\nmarket depends on all of the following:\\n\\n \\nR\\nating\\n\\n \\nI\\nnterest rates\\n\\n \\nTe\\nrm\\n\\n \\nC\\noupon rate\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of bond\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuer\\n', '38\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\nS\\nupply and demand\\n\\n \\nO\\nther features, i.e., callable, convertible\\nCorporate bonds are always priced as a percentage of par and par value \\nfor all bonds is always $1,000, unless otherwise stated.\\nPAR VALUE\\nPar value of a bond is equal to the amount that the investor has loaned to the \\nissuer. ˛e terms par value, face value, and principal amount are synonymous \\nand are always equal to $1,000. ˛e principal amount is the amount that will \\nbe received by the investor at maturity, regardless of the price the investor \\npaid for the bond. An investor who purchases a bond in the secondary market \\nfor $1,000 is said to have paid par for the bond.\\nDISCOUNT\\nIn the secondary market, many di˜erent factors a˜ect the price of the bond. \\nIt is not at all unusual for an investor to purchase a bond at a price that is \\nbelow the bond™s par value.

To ˚nd any investment™s cur\\n-\\nrent yield, use the following formula:\\nAnnual income/current market price\\nFor example, let™s take the same 8% corporate bond used in the previous \\nexample on nominal yield and see what its current yield would be if we paid \\n$1,100 for the bond.\\nAnnual income \\n˛\\n 8%\\n˜˚˜\\n$1,000 \\n˛\\n $80\\nCurrent market price \\n˛\\n 110%\\n˜˚˜\\n$1,000 \\n˛\\n $1,100\\nCurrent yield \\n˛\\n $80/$1,100 \\n˛\\n 7.27%\\n', '40\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nIn this example, we have purchased the bond at a premium or a price \\nthat is higher than par and we see that the current yield on the bond is lower \\nthan the nominal yield.\\nLet™s take a look at the current yield on the same bond if we were to pur\\n-\\nchase the bond at a discount or a price which is lower than par.

By showing examples calculating the current yield for the same bond \\npurchased at both a premium and a discount, we have demonstrated the \\ninverse relationship between prices and yields. ˛at is to say, prices and yields \\non income-producing investments move in the opposite direction. As the \\nprice of an investment rises, the investment™s yield falls. Conversely, as the \\nprice of the investment falls, the investment™s yield will rise.\\nYIELD TO MATURITY\\nA bond™s yield to maturity is the investor™s total annualized return for invest\\n-\\ning in the bond. A bond™s yield to maturity takes into consideration the annual \\nincome received by the investor along with any di˜erence between the price \\nthe investor paid for the bond and the par value that will be received at matu\\n-\\nrity. It also assumes that the investor is reinvesting the semiannual interest \\npayments at the same rate. ˛e yield to maturity is the most important yield \\nfor an investor who purchases the bond.\\nYIELD TO MATURITY: PREMIUM BOND\\n˛e yield to maturity for a bond purchased at a premium will be the lowest \\nof all the investor™s yields. Although an investor may purchase a bond at a \\nprice that exceeds the par value of the bond, the issuer is only obligated to \\npay the bondholder the par value upon maturity. For example: An investor \\nwho purchases a bond at 110 or for $1,100 will receive only $1,000 at matu\\n-\\nrity and, therefore, will lose the di˜erence of $100. ˛is loss is what causes \\nthe yield to maturity to be the lowest of the three yields for an investor who \\npurchases a bond at a premium.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n41\\nYIELD TO MATURITY: DISCOUNT BOND\\n˛e yield to maturity for a bond purchased at a discount will be the highest \\nof all of the investor™s yields. In this case, the investor has purchased the \\nbond at a price that is less than the par value of the bond. In this example, \\neven though the investor paid less than the par value for the bond, the issuer \\nis still obligated to pay them the full par value of the bond at maturity or \\nthe full $1,000. For example: An investor who purchases a bond at 90 or for \\n$900 will still be entitled to receive the full par amount of $1,000 at matu\\n-\\nrity, therefore, gaining $100. ˛is gain is what causes the yield to maturity \\nto be the highest of the three yields for an investor who purchases a bond \\nat a discount.\\nCALCULATING THE YIELD TO MATURITY\\nWhen an investor purchases a bond in the secondary market at a discount, the \\ndiscount must be accreted over the remaining life of the bond. ˛e accretion \\nof the discount will result in a higher yield to maturity. When an investor \\npurchases a bond in the secondary market at a premium, the premium must \\nbe amortized over the remaining life of the bond. ˛e amortization of the \\npremium will result in a lower yield to maturity.\\nIn order to calculate the bonds approximate yield to maturity, use the \\nfollowing formulas:\\nFor a bond purchased at a discount use:\\n(Annual interest \\n˝\\n annualized discount)\\nPrice paid \\n˝\\n PAR\\n2\\n˛e annualized discount is found by taking the total discount and dividing it \\nby the number of years remaining until maturity. For example, let™s assume \\nan investor purchased a 10% bond at $900 with 10 years until maturity. ˛e \\nbonds approximate yield to maturity would be found as follows:\\n($100 \\n˝\\n $10)\\n$900 \\n˝\\n $1,000\\n \\n2\\nIn this case, the bond™s approximate yield to maturity is 11.57%.\\n][\\n][\\n', '42\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nFor a bond purchased at a premium use:\\n(Annual interest\\n˜˙˜\\nannualized premium)\\nPrice paid \\n˝\\n PAR\\n \\n2\\n˛e annualized premium is found by taking the total premium and divid\\n-\\ning it by the number of years remaining until maturity. For example, let™s \\nassume an investor purchased a 10% bond at $1,100 with 10 years until maturity.\\n˛e bond™s approximate yield to maturity would be found as follows:\\n($100\\n˜˙˜\\n$10)\\n$1,100 \\n˝\\n $1,000\\n \\n2\\nIn this case, the bond™s approximate yield to maturity is 8.57%.\\nCALCULATING THE YIELD TO CALL\\nIn the event that the bond may be called in or redeemed by the issuer under a \\ncall feature, an investor may calculate the approximate yield to call by using \\nthe approximate number of years le˝ until the bond may be called.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nThe yield to call will always extend past the yield to maturity. The yield to \\ncall will always be the highest yield on a bond purchased at a discount \\nand it will always be the lowest yield for a bond purchased at a premium.\\nREALIZED COMPOUND YIELD RETURNS\\nPortfolio managers can determine how changing interest rates will a˜ect a \\nbond™s yield to maturity by calculating its realized compound yield. A bond™s \\nrealized compound yield measures a bond™s annual return based on the semi\\n-\\nannual compounding of coupon payments. ˛e bond™s realized compound \\nyield will largely depend on the purchase price of the bond and the rate at \\nwhich the interest payments are reinvested. Investors with longer holding \\nperiods will have higher total dollar and percentage returns.\\n][\\n][\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n43\\nYIELD SPREADS\\nInvestors must look at the competing yields that are o˜ered by a wide variety of \\nbonds. ˛e di˜erence in the yields o˜ered by two bonds is known as the yield \\nspread. Many bonds are measured by the relationship between the bond™s yield \\nand the yield o˜ered by similar term Treasury securities. ˛is is known as the \\nspread over Treasuries. As perceptions about the issuer and the economy change, \\nyield spreads will change. During times of uncertainty, investors will be less \\nlikely to hold more risky debt securities. As a result, the yield spread between \\nTreasuries and more risky corporate debt will widen. An increase in the spread \\ncan be seen as an indication that the economy is going to go into a recession \\nand that the issuers of lower quality debt will likely default. Alternatively, a \\ndecrease in the spread will be seen as a predictor of an improving economy.\\nTHE REAL INTEREST RATE\\nInvestors must calculate the e˜ect in˙ation will have on the interest they \\nreceive on ˚xed-income securities. ˛e interest rate received by an investor, \\nbefore the e˜ects of in˙ation are considered, is known as the nominal inter\\n-\\nest rate. ˛e real interest rate is what the investor will receive a˝er in˙ation \\nis factored in. For example, if an investor is receiving an 8% interest rate on \\na corporate bond when in˙ation is running at 2%, the investor™s real interest \\nrate would be 6%. ˛e investor™s nominal interest rate consists of the real \\ninterest rate plus an in˙ation premium. ˛e in˙ation premium factors in the \\nexpected rate of in˙ation during various bond maturities.\\nBOND MATURITIES\\nWhen a bond matures, the principal payment and the last semiannual interest \\npayment are due. Corporations will select to issue bonds with the maturity type \\nthat best ˚ts their needs, based on the interest rate environment and marketability.\\nTERM MATURITY\\nA term bond is the most common type of corporate bond issue. With a \\nterm bond, the entire principal amount becomes due on a speci˚c date. \\nFor example, if XYZ corporation issued $100,000,000 worth of 8% bonds \\ndue June 1, 2025, the entire $100,000,000 would be due to bondholders on \\n', '44\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nJune 1,\\n \\n2025. On June 1,\\n \\nbondholders would also receive their last semiannual \\ninterest payment and their principal payment.\\nSERIAL MATURITY\\nA serial bond issue is one that has a portion of the issue maturing over a \\nseries of years. Traditionally, serial bonds have larger portions of the principal \\nmaturing in later years. ˛e portion of the bonds maturing in later years will \\ncarry a higher yield to maturity because investors who have their money at \\nrisk longer will demand a higher interest rate.\\nBALLOON MATURITY\\nA balloon issue contains a maturity schedule that repays a portion of the issue™s \\nprincipal over a number of years, just like a serial issue. However, with a balloon \\nmaturity, the largest portion of the principal amount is due on the last date.\\nSERIES ISSUE\\nWith a series issue, corporations may elect to spread the issuance of the bonds \\nover a period of several years. ˛is will give the corporation the ˙exibility to \\nborrow money to meet its goals as its needs change.\\nTYPES OF CORPORATE BONDS\\nA corporation will issue or sell bonds as a means to borrow money to help \\nthe organization meet its goals. Corporate bonds are divided into two main \\ncategories: secured and unsecured.\\nSECURED BONDS\\nA secured bond is one that is backed by a speci˚c pledge of assets. ˛e assets \\nthat have been pledged become known as collateral for the bond issue or the \\nloan. A trustee will hold the title to the collateral and, in the event of default, \\nthe bondholders may claim the assets that have been pledged. ˛e trustee \\nthen will attempt to sell o˜ the assets in an e˜ort to pay o˜ the bondholders.\\nMORTGAGE BONDS\\nA mortgage bond is a bond that has been backed by a pledge of real property. \\n˛e corporation will issue bonds to investors and the corporation will pledge \\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n45\\nreal estate, owned by the company, as collateral. A mortgage bond works in \\na similar fashion to a residential mortgage. In the event of default, the bond\\n-\\nholders take the property.\\nEQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES\\nAn equipment trust certi˚cate is backed by a pledge of large equipment that \\nthe corporation owns. Airlines, railroads, and large shipping companies o˝en \\nwill borrow money to purchase the equipment that they need through the \\nsale of equipment trust certi˚cates. Airplanes, railroad cars, and ships are \\nall good examples of the types of assets that might be pledged as collateral. \\nIn the event of default, the equipment will be liquidated by the trustee in an \\ne˜ort to pay o˜ the bondholders.\\nCOLLATERAL TRUST CERTIFICATES\\nA collateral trust certi˚cate is a bond that has been backed by a pledge of \\nsecurities that the issuer has purchased for investment purposes or they could \\nbe backed by shares of a wholly owned subsidiary. Both stocks and bonds \\nare acceptable forms of collateral as long as another issuer has issued them. \\nSecurities that have been pledged as collateral are generally required to be \\nheld by the trustee for safekeeping. In the event of a default, the trustee will \\nattempt to liquidate the securities, which have been pledged as collateral, and \\ndivide the proceeds among the bondholders.\\nIt™s important to note that while having a speci˚c claim against an asset \\nthat has been pledged as collateral bene˚ts the bondholder, bondholders do \\nnot want to take title to the collateral. Bondholders invest for the semiannual \\ninterest payments and the return of their principal at maturity.\\nUNSECURED BONDS\\nUnsecured bonds are known as debentures and have no speci˚c asset pledged \\nas collateral for the loan. Debentures are only backed by the good faith and \\ncredit of the issuer. In the event of a default, the holder of a debenture is \\ntreated like a general creditor.\\nSUBORDINATED DEBENTURES\\nA subordinated debenture is an unsecured loan to the issuer that has a junior \\nclaim on the issuer in the event of default relative to the straight debenture. \\nShould the issuer default, the holders of the debentures and other general \\ncreditors will be paid before the holders of the subordinate debentures will \\nbe paid anything.\\n', '46\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nINCOME/ADJUSTMENT BONDS\\nCorporations, usually in severe ˚nancial diˆculty, issue income or adjustment \\nbonds. ˛e bond is unsecured and the investor is only promised to be paid \\ninterest if the corporation has enough income to do so. As a result of the large \\nrisk that the investor is taking, the interest rate is very high and the bonds \\nare issued at a deep discount to par. An income bond is never an appropriate \\nrecommendation for an investor seeking income or safety of principal.\\nZERO˜COUPON BONDS\\nA zero-coupon bond is a bond that pays no semiannual interest. It is issued \\nat a deep discount from the par value and appreciates up to par at maturity. \\n˛is appreciation represents the investor™s interest for purchasing the bond. \\nCorporations, the U.S. government, and municipalities will all issue zero-\\ncoupon bonds in an e˜ort to ˚nance their activities. An investor might be \\nable to purchase the $1,000 principal payment in 20 years for as little as $300 \\ntoday. Because zero-coupon bonds pay no semiannual interest and the price \\nis so deeply discounted from par, the price of the bond will be the most sen\\n-\\nsitive to a change in the interest rates. Both corporate and U.S. government \\nzero-coupon bonds subject the investor to federal income taxes on the annual \\nappreciation of the bond. ˛is is known as phantom income.\\nGUARANTEED BONDS\\nA guaranteed bond is a bond whose interest and principal payments are \\nguaranteed by a third party such as a parent company. ˛e higher the credit \\nrating of the company who is guaranteeing the bonds the better the guarantee.\\nCONVERTIBLE BONDS\\nA convertible bond is a corporate bond that may be converted or exchanged \\nfor common shares of the corporation at a predetermined price known as the \\nconversion price. Convertible bonds have bene˚ts to both the issuer and the \\ninvestor. Because the bond is convertible, it usually will pay a lower rate of inter\\n-\\nest than nonconvertible bonds. ˛is lower interest rate can save the corporation \\nan enormous amount of money in interest expense over the life of the issue. \\n˛e convertible feature will also bene˚t the investor if the \\n \\nc\\nommon stock does \\nwell. If the shares of the underlying common stock appreciate, the investor \\ncould realize signi˚cant capital appreciation in the price of the bond and may \\nalso elect to convert the bond into common stock in the hopes of realizing \\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n47\\nadditional appreciation. As an investor in the bond, they maintain a senior \\nposition as a creditor while enjoying the potential for capital appreciation.\\nCONVERTING BONDS INTO COMMON STOCK\\nAll Series 65 candidates must be able to perform the conversion calculations \\nfor both convertible bonds and preferred stock. It is essential that prospective \\nrepresentatives are able to determine the following:\\nNumber of shares:\\n To determine the number of shares that can be received \\nupon conversion, use the following formula:\\nPar value/conversion price\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nXYZ has a 7% subordinated debenture trading in the market place at 120. \\nThe bonds are convertible into XYZ common stock at $25 per share. How \\nmany shares can the investor receive upon conversion?\\n$1,000/$25 \\n˛\\n 40 shares\\nThe investor is entitled to receive 40 shares of XYZ common stock for \\neach bond that he or she owns.\\nPARITY PRICE\\nA stock™s parity price determines the value at which the stock must be priced \\nin order for the value of the common stock to be equal to the value of the bond \\nthat the investor already owns. ˛e value of the stock that can be received by \\nthe investor upon conversion must be equal to, or at parity with, the value of \\nthe bond. Otherwise, converting the bonds into common stock would not \\nmake economic sense. Determining parity price is a two-step process. First, \\none must determine the number of shares that can be received by using the \\nformula: par value/conversion price. ˛en it is necessary to calculate the price \\nof each share at the parity price.\\nTo determine parity price, use the following formula:\\nCurrent market value of the convertible bond\\nNumber of shares to be received\\n', '48\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nIn this example, the convertible bond was quoted at 120, which equals \\na dollar price of $1,200. We determined that the investor could receive 40 \\nshares of stock for each bond so the parity price equals:\\n$1,200/40 \\n˛\\n $30\\nIf the question is looking for the number of shares or the parity price for \\na convertible preferred stock, the formulas are the same and the only thing \\nthat changes is the par value. Par value for all preferred stocks is $100 instead \\nof $1,000 par value for bonds.\\nADVANTAGES OF ISSUING CONVERTIBLE BONDS\\nOnly corporations may issue convertible bonds. Some of the advantages of \\nissuing convertible bonds to the company are:\\n\\n \\nM\\nakes the issue more marketable\\n\\n \\nC\\nan o˜er a lower interest rate\\n\\n \\nI\\nf the bonds are converted, the debt obligation is eliminated.\\n\\n \\n˛\\ne issuance of the convertible bonds does not immediately dilute owner\\n-\\nship or earnings per share.\\nDISADVANTAGES OF ISSUING CONVERTIBLE BONDS\\n˛ere are some disadvantages to issuing convertible bonds for the company \\nsuch as:\\n\\n \\nR\\neduced leverage upon conversion\\n\\n \\nC\\nonversion causes the loss of tax-deductible interest payments\\n\\n \\nC\\nonversion dilutes shareholder™s equity\\n\\n \\nC\\nonversion by a large holder may shi˝ control of the company\\nCONVERTIBLE BONDS AND STOCK SPLITS\\nIf a corporation declares a stock split or a stock dividend, the conversion price \\nof the bond will be adjusted accordingly. ˛e trust indenture of a convertible \\nbond will state the maximum number of shares that the corporation may \\nissue while the bonds are outstanding, as well as the minimum price at which \\nthe additional shares may be issued.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n49\\nTHE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939\\n˛e Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that corporate bond issues in \\nexcess of $5,000,000, that are to be repaid during a term in excess of one \\nyear, issue a trust indenture for the issue. ˛e trust indenture is a contract \\nbetween the issuer and the trustee. ˛e trustee acts on behalf of all of the \\nbondholders and ensures that the issuer is in compliance with all of the \\npromises and covenants made to the bondholders. ˛e trustee is appointed \\nby the corporation and is usually a bank or a trust company. ˛e Trust \\nIndenture Act of 1939 only applies to corporate issuers. Both federal and \\nmunicipal issuers are exempt.\\nBOND INDENTURE\\nCorporate bonds may be issued with either an open-end or closed-end \\nindenture. Bonds issued with an open-end indenture allow the corporation \\nto issue additional bonds secured by the same collateral and whose claim \\non the collateral is equal to the original issue. A closed-end indenture does \\nnot allow the corporation to issue additional bonds having an equal claim \\non the collateral. If the corporation wants to issue new bonds, their claim \\nmust be subordinate to the claim of the original issue or secured by other \\ncollateral.\\nRATINGS CONSIDERATIONS\\nWhen the rating agencies assign a rating to a debt issue, they must look at \\nmany factors concerning the issuer™s ˚nancial condition such as:\\n\\n \\nC\\nash ˙ow\\n\\n \\nT\\notal amount and type of debt outstanding\\n\\n \\nA\\nbility to meet interest and principal payments\\n\\n \\nC\\nollateral\\n\\n \\nI\\nndustry and economic trends\\n\\n \\nM\\nanagement\\nS&P and Moody™s are the two biggest ratings agencies. In order for a \\ncorporation to have their debt rated by one of these agencies, the issuer must \\nrequest it and pay for the service. One of the main reasons a corporation would \\n', '50\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nwant to have their debt rated is because many investors will not purchase \\nbonds that have not been rated. Additionally, if the issuer receives a higher \\nrating, they will be able to sell the bonds with a lower interest rate.\\n \\nFOCUS\\nPOINT\\n \\nStandard & Poor™s\\nMoody™s\\nAAA\\nAaa\\nInvestment grade or high grade\\nBBB\\nBaa\\nSpeculative high-yield junk bonds\\nEXCHANGE TRADED NOTES (ETNs)\\nExchange-traded notes sometimes known as equity-linked notes or index-\\nlinked notes are debt securities that base a maturity payment on the perfor\\n-\\nmance of an underlying security or group of securities such as an index. ETNs \\ndo not make coupon or interest payments to investors during the time the \\ninvestor owns the ETN. ETNs may be purchased and sold at any time during \\nthe trading day and may be purchased on margin and sold short. One very \\nimportant risk factor to consider when evaluating an ETN is the fact that ETNs \\nare unsecured and carry the credit risk of the issuing bank or broker dealer. \\nSimilarly, principal protected notes (PPNs), which are structured products \\nthat guarantee the return of the investor™s principal if the note is held until \\nmaturity, carry a principal guarantee that is only as good as the issuer™s credit \\nrating and therefore are never 100% guaranteed.\\nEURO AND YANKEE BONDS\\nA Eurobond is a bond issued in domestic currency of the issuer but sold outside \\nof the issuer™s country. For example, if Virgin Plc sold bonds to investors in \\nJapan with the principal and interest payable in British pounds, this would be \\nan example of a Eurobond. A Eurobond carries signi˚cant currency risk should \\nthe value of the foreign currency fall relative to the domestic currency of the \\npurchaser. If the foreign currency fell, the interest and principal payments to \\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n51\\nbe received in the foreign currency would result in the receipt of fewer units of \\nthe domestic currency upon conversion. A Eurodollar bond is a bond issued \\nby a foreign issuer denominated in U.S. dollars and sold to investors outside \\nof the U.S. and outside of the issuer™s country. Eurodollar bonds are issued in \\nbarer form by foreign corporations, federal governments, and municipalities. \\nEurobonds trade with accrued interest and interest is paid annually.\\nA Yankee bond is similar to a Eurodollar bond, except, Yankee bonds are \\ndollar denominated bonds issued by a foreign issuer and sold to U.S. investors. \\nIf Virgin sold the same bonds to U.S. investors but the bond™s interest and \\nprincipal were denominated in U.S. dollars rather than in British pounds, \\nthe bonds would be a Yankee bond. ˛e advantage of a Yankee bond over \\na Eurobond for U.S. investors is that the Yankee bond does not have any \\ncurrency risk.\\nVARIABLE RATE SECURITIES\\n˛e two main types of variable rate securities are Auction Rate Securities \\nand Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDO). Auction Rate Securities are \\nlong-term securities that are traded as short-term securities. ˛e interest rate \\npaid will be reset at regularly scheduled auctions for the securities every 7, \\n28, or 35 days. Investors who buy or who elect to hold the securities will have \\nthe interest rate paid on the securities reset to the clearing rate until the next \\nauction. Should the auction fail due to a lack of demand, investors who were \\nlooking to sell the securities may not have immediate access to their funds. \\nVRDOs have the interest rate reset at set intervals daily, weekly, or monthly. \\n˛e interest rate set on the VRDO is set by the dealer to a rate that will allow \\nthe instruments to be priced at par. Investors may elect to put the securities \\nback to the issuer or a third party on the reset date. Variable rate securities \\nmay be issued as debt securities or as preferred stock o˜erings.\\nRETIRING CORPORATE BONDS\\n˛e retirement of a corporation™s debt may occur under any of the following \\nmethods:\\n\\n \\nR\\nedemption\\n\\n \\nRe\\nfunding\\n\\n \\nP\\nrerefunding\\n', '52\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\nE\\nxercise of a call feature by the company\\n\\n \\nE\\nxercise of a put feature by the investor\\n\\n \\nT\\nender o˜ering\\n\\n \\nO\\npen market purchases\\nREDEMPTION\\nBonds are redeemed upon maturity and the principal amount is repaid to \\ninvestors. At maturity, investors also will receive their last semiannual interest \\npayment.\\nREFUNDING\\nMany times corporations will use the sale of new bonds to pay o˜ the princi\\n-\\npal of their outstanding bonds. Corporations will issue new bonds to refund \\ntheir maturing bonds or call the outstanding issue in whole or in part under a \\ncall feature. ˛is is known as refunding corporate debt. Refunding corporate \\ndebt is very similar to re˚nancing a home mortgage.\\nPREREFUNDING\\nA corporation may seek to take advantage of a low interest rate environment \\nby prerefunding their outstanding bonds prior to being able to retire them \\nunder a call feature. ˛e proceeds from the new issue of bonds are placed in \\nan escrow account and invested in government securities. ˛e interest gener\\n-\\nated in the escrow account is used to pay the debt service of the outstanding \\nor prerefunded issue. ˛e prerefunded issue will be called in by the company \\non the ˚rst call date. Because the prerefunded bonds are now backed by the \\ngovernment securities held in the escrow account, they are automatically rated \\nAAA. Once an issue has been prerefunded (or advance refunded), the issuer™s \\nobligations under the indenture are terminated. ˛is is known as defeasance.\\nCALLING IN BONDS\\nMany times corporations will attach a call feature to their bonds that will \\nallow them to call in and retire the bonds, either at their discretion or on \\na set schedule. ˛e call feature gives the corporation the ability to manage \\nthe amount of debt outstanding, as well as the ability to take advantage of \\nfavorable interest rate environments. Most bonds are not callable in the ˚rst \\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n53\\nseveral years a˝er issuance. ˛is is known as call protection. A call feature \\non a bond bene˚ts the company, not the investor.\\nPUTTING BONDS TO THE COMPANY\\nAs a way to make a bond issue more attractive to investors, a company may \\nattach a put feature or put option on their bonds. Under a put option, the \\nholder of the bonds may tender the bonds to the company for redemption. \\nSome put features will allow the bondholders to put the bonds to the company \\nfor redemption if their rating falls to low or if interest rates rise signi˚cantly. \\nA put option on a bond bene˚ts the bondholder.\\nTENDER OFFERS\\nA company may make a tender o˜er in an e˜ort to reduce its outstand\\n-\\ning debt or as a way to take advantage of low interest rates. Tender o˜ers \\nmay be made for both callable and noncallable bonds. Companies usually \\nwill o˜er a premium for the bonds in order to make the o˜er attractive to \\nbondholders.\\nOPEN-MARKET PURCHASES\\nIssuers, in an e˜ort to reduce the amount of their outstanding debt, may \\nsimply repurchase the bonds in the marketplace.\\nMUNICIPAL BONDS\\nState and local governments will issue municipal bonds in order to help \\nlocal governments meet their ˚nancial needs. Most municipal bonds are \\nconsidered to be almost as safe as Treasury securities issued by the federal \\ngovernment. However, unlike the federal government, from time to time an \\nissuer of municipal securities does default. ˛e degree of safety varies from \\nstate to state and from municipality to municipality. Municipal securities \\nmay be issued by:\\n\\n \\nS\\ntates\\n\\n \\nT\\nerritorial possessions of the United States, such as Puerto Rico\\n\\n \\nL\\negally constituted taxing authorities and their agencies\\n\\n \\nP\\nublic authorities that supervise ports and mass transit\\n', '54\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTYPES OF MUNICIPAL BONDS\\nGENERAL OBLIGATION BOND\\nGeneral obligation bonds (also known as GOs) are full faith and credit bonds. \\n˛e bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer and by their \\nability to raise and levy taxes. In essence, tax revenues back the bonds. GOs \\no˝en will be issued to fund projects that bene˚t the entire community and \\nthe ˚nanced projects generally do not produce revenue of any kind. General \\nobligation bonds would be issued, for example, to fund a local park, a new \\nschool building, or a new police station. General obligation bonds that have \\nbeen issued by the state are backed by income and sales taxes while GOs \\nthat have been issued by local governments or municipalities are backed by \\nproperty taxes.\\nVOTER APPROVAL\\nGeneral obligation bonds are a drain on the tax revenue of the state or \\nmunicipality that issues them. The amount of general obligation bonds \\nthat may be issued must be within certain debt limits and requires voter \\napproval. The maximum amount of general obligation debt that may be \\nissued is known as the statutory debt limit. State and municipal govern\\n-\\nments may not issue general obligation debt in excess of their statutory \\nlimit.\\nPROPERTY TAXES\\nGeneral obligation bonds issued at the local level are mostly supported by \\nproperty tax revenue received from property owners. A property owner™s taxes \\nare based on the assessed value of the property, not on its actual market value. \\nTowns will periodically send an assessor to inspect properties and determine \\nwhat the properties™ assessed values are.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA homeowner whose home has a market value of $100,000 will not be taxed \\non the entire market value of the home. If the town uses a 75% assessment \\nrate, the home™s assessed value would be $75,000.\\nOVERLAPPING DEBT\\nTaxpayers are subject to the taxing authority of various municipal authorities. \\nMunicipal debt that is issued by di˜erent municipal authorities that draws \\nrevenue from the same base of taxpayers is known as overlapping debt or \\ncoterminous debt.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n55\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\n˛e county water authority issued bonds that are supported by the property \\ntaxes levied in the county. ˛e water authority™s debt overlaps the towns™ and \\ncounty™s other general obligation debt by drawing support from the same tax \\nrevenue.

Interest earned by some high-income earners on industrial \\ndevelopment bonds may be subject to the investor™s alternative minimum tax. \\nStates are limited as to the amount of industrial revenue bonds that may be \\nissued, based on the population of the state.\\n', '56\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nLEASE RENTAL BONDS\\nA lease-back arrangement is created when a municipality issues a municipal \\nbond to build a facility for an authority or agency such as a school district. \\n˛e proceeds of the issue would be used to build the facility that is then leased \\nto the agency and the lease payments will support the bond™s debt service.\\nSPECIAL TAX BONDS\\nA special tax bond is issued to meet a speci˚c goal. ˛e bond™s debt service \\nis paid only by revenue generated from speci˚c taxes. ˛e debt service on \\nspecial tax bonds is, in many cases, supported by ﬁsinﬂ taxes, such as taxes on \\nalcohol, tobacco, gasoline, hotel and motel fees, and business licenses. Keep in \\nmind that special tax bonds are revenue bonds, not general obligation bonds.\\nSPECIAL ASSESSMENT BONDS\\nA special assessment bond will be issued in order to ˚nance a project that \\nbene˚ts a speci˚c geographic area or portion of a municipality. Sidewalks and \\nreservoirs are examples of projects that may be ˚nanced through issuance of \\nspecial assessment bonds. ˛e homeowners in the area that bene˚t from the \\nproject will be subject to a special tax assessment. ˛e assessment then will \\nbe used to support the debt service of the bonds. Homeowners that do not \\nbene˚t from the project are not subject to the tax assessment.\\nDOUBLE-BARRELED BONDS\\nDouble-barreled bonds are bonds that have been issued to build or maintain \\na revenue-producing facility such as a bridge or a roadway. ˛e initial debt \\nservice is supported by the user fees generated by the facility. However, if the \\nrevenue generated by the facility is insuˆcient to support the bond™s inter\\n-\\nest and principal payments, the payments will be supported by the general \\ntax revenue of the state or municipality. ˛e debt service on double-barreled \\nbonds is backed by two sources of revenue. Because the tax revenue of the \\nstate or municipality also backs them, revenue bonds are rated and trade like \\ngeneral obligation bonds.\\nMORAL OBLIGATION BONDS\\nA moral obligation bond is issued to build or maintain a revenue-producing \\nfacility such as a park that charges an entrance fee or a tunnel that charges \\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n57\\na toll. If the revenue generated by the facility is insuˆcient to cover the debt \\nservice, the state legislature may vote to allocate tax revenue to cover the \\nshortfall. A moral obligation bond does not require that the state cover any \\nshortfall; it merely gives them the option to. Some reasons why a state may \\nelect to cover a shortfall are to:\\n\\n \\nK\\neep a high credit rating on all municipal issues\\n\\n \\nE\\nnsure that interest rates on their municipal issues do not rise\\nNEW HOUSING AUTHORITY/\\nPUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY\\nNew housing authority (NHA) and public housing authority (PHA) bonds \\nare issued to build low-income housing. ˛e initial debt service for the bonds \\nis the rental income received from the project™s tenants. Should the rental \\nincome be insuˆcient to cover the bond™s debt service, the U.S. government \\nwill cover any shortfall. Because the payments are guaranteed by the fed\\n-\\neral government, NHA/PHA bonds are considered to be the safest type of \\nmunicipal bond. NHA/PHA bonds are not considered to be double-barreled \\nbonds because any shortfall will be covered by the federal government, not \\nthe state or municipal government.\\nSHORT-TERM MUNICIPAL FINANCING\\nStates and municipalities, like other issuers, need to obtain short-term \\n˚nancing to manage their cash ˙ow and will sell both short-term notes and \\ntax-exempt commercial paper. Short-term notes are sold in anticipation of \\nreceiving other revenue and are issued an MIG rating by Moody™s investor \\nservice. ˛e MIG ratings range from 1 to 4, with a rating of MIG 1 being the \\nhighest and a rating of MIG 4 being the lowest. ˛e types of short-term notes \\na state or municipality may issue are:\\n\\n \\nT\\nax anticipation notes (TANs)\\n\\n \\nR\\nevenue anticipation notes (RANs)\\n\\n \\nB\\nond anticipation notes (BANs)\\n\\n \\nT\\nax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs)\\nMunicipal tax-exempt commercial paper matures in 270 days or less and \\nusually will be backed by a line of credit at a bank.\\n', '58\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTAXATION OF MUNICIPAL BONDS\\n˛e interest earned by investors from municipal bonds is free from fed\\n-\\neral income taxes. ˛e doctrine of reciprocal immunity, established by \\nthe Supreme Court in 1895, sets forth that the federal government will \\nnot tax the interest earned by investors from municipal securities and \\nthat the states will not tax interest earned by investors on federal securi\\n-\\nties. ˛e decision that established this doctrine was repealed in 1986 and \\nallows for the federal taxation of municipal bond interest. ˛is, however, \\nis highly unlikely.\\nTAX-EQUIVALENT YIELD\\nIt™s important for investors to consider the tax implications of investing \\nin municipal bonds. Because the interest earned from municipal bonds \\nis federally tax free, municipal bonds will offer a lower rate than other \\nbonds of similar quality. Even though the rate is oftentimes much lower, \\nthe investor may still be better off with the lower rate municipal than \\nwith a higher rate corporate bond. Investors in a higher tax bracket will \\nrealize a greater benefit from the tax exemption than investors in a lower \\ntax bracket. To determine where an investor would be better off after \\ntaxes, look to the tax-equivalent yield that is found by using the follow\\n-\\ning formula:\\nTax-free yield (100%\\n˜˙˜\\ninvestor™s tax bracket)\\nFor example, take an investor considering purchasing a municipal \\nbond with a coupon rate of 7%. ˛e investor is also considering investing \\nin a corporate bond instead. ˛e investor is in the 30% federal tax bracket \\nand wants to determine which bond is going to give the greatest return \\na˝er taxes.\\nTax-equivalent yield \\n˛\\n 7%/(100% Œ 30%) \\n˛\\n 7%/.7 \\n˛\\n 10%\\nIn this example, if the corporate bond of similar quality does not yield \\nmore than 10%, then the investor will be better o˜ with the municipal bond. \\nHowever, if the corporate bond yields more than 10%, the investor will be \\nbetter o˜ with the corporate bond.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n59\\nPURCHASING A MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUED IN \\nTHE STATE IN WHICH THE INVESTOR RESIDES\\nIf an investor purchases a municipal bond issued within the state in which he \\nor she resides, then the interest earned on the bond will be free from federal, \\nstate, and local income taxes.\\nTRIPLE TAX FREE\\nMunicipal bonds that have been issued by a territory such as Puerto Rico or \\nGuam are given tax-free status for the interest payments from federal, state, \\nand local income taxes.\\nORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (OID) AND \\nSECONDARY MARKET DISCOUNTS\\nPurchasers of original issue discount bonds, as well as those that have been \\npurchased in the secondary market, are required to accrete the discount over \\nthe number of years remaining to maturity. ˛at is to say, the investor must \\nstep up their cost base by the annualized discount each year.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf an investor purchases a municipal bond in the secondary market at $900 \\nwith 10 years remaining to maturity, the investor would be required to step \\nup their cost base each year by the annualized discount. ˛e annualized \\ndiscount is found by:\\nTotal discount\\nNo. of years to maturity\\n$100/10 years \\n˛\\n $10 per year\\n˛e investor in this example would have to step up their cost base $10 per \\nyear.

A wash sale would result in the loss being disal\\n-\\nlowed by the IRS, because a bond swap does not a˜ect the investor™s ability \\nto claim the loss.\\nANALYZING MUNICIPAL BONDS\\nThe quality and safety of municipal bonds vary from issuer to issuer. \\nInvestors who purchase municipal securities need to be able to deter\\n-\\nmine the risk that may be associated with a particular issuer or with a \\nparticular bond.\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n61\\nANALYZING GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS\\n˛e quality of a general obligation bond is largely determined by the ˚nan\\n-\\ncial health of the issuing state or municipality. General obligation bonds are \\nsupported through the tax revenue that has been received by the issuer. ˛e \\nability of the issuer to levy and collect tax revenue varies from state to state \\nand from municipality to municipality. It is important that the fundamental \\nhealth of the issuer be examined before investing in municipal bonds. Just \\nas an investor would read a company™s ˚nancial reports before purchasing \\ntheir stock or bonds, an investor should read a state or municipality™s reports \\nbefore purchasing their bonds.\\nDURATION\\nIn a normal interest rate environment, longer-term bonds will pay investors \\na higher interest rate than short-term bonds of equal quality. As interest \\nrates change, the price of existing bonds will move inversely to the change in \\ninterest rates. A bond™s duration is a measure of the bond™s price sensitivity \\nto a small change in interest rates and is stated in years. Longer-term bonds \\nand bonds with low coupons will generally have a higher duration than \\nshorter-term or higher-yielding bonds. ˛e higher the bond™s duration, the \\ngreater the bond™s interest rate risk and the greater its price volatility. Dura\\n-\\ntion allows investors to compare the interest rate risk associated with bonds \\nof di˜erent maturities, quality, and coupons. ˛e bond™s duration may be \\nstated as either modi˚ed duration or e˜ective duration. Modi˚ed duration \\nassumes that a change in interest rates will not a˜ect the bond™s expected \\ncash ˙ow. E˜ective or call-adjusted duration assumes that a change in inter\\n-\\nest rates may a˜ect the bond™s cash ˙ow if the bonds are callable or have \\nother options for early retirement. Call-adjusted duration is lower than the \\nbond™s duration to maturity. All bonds that make regular interest payments \\nwill have a duration that is lower than the number of years to the bond™s \\nmaturity. Because a zero-coupon bond does not provide any cash ˙ow other \\nthan its principal payment at maturity, a zero-coupon bond™s duration will \\nbe equal to the number of years to maturity. For example, a 20-year zero-\\ncoupon bond would have a duration of 20. To determine a bond™s duration, \\nuse the following formula:\\nBond price change percentage \\n˛\\n duration\\n˜˚˜\\n(change in yield in basis \\npoints/100)\\n', '62\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf a bond portfolio has an average duration of 7 years and interest rates rise \\nby 1% or 100 basis points, the portfolio manager can expect the price of the \\nbonds in the portfolio to fall by 7%.\\nCONVEXITY\\nA bond™s convexity measures its price volatility to large changes in interest \\nrates. A bond™s price will not respond equally to both an increase and decrease \\nin interest rates. As interest rates fall, bonds tend to increase in price more \\nthan they would fall if interest rates were to rise by an equal amount. Bond \\nprices tend to rise faster in response to a fall in interest rates and fall slower \\nin response to a rise in interest rates. Bonds whose prices react in this way \\nare said to have positive convexity. Mortgage-backed and callable bonds tend \\nto have negative convexities. A fall in interest rates increases both mortgage \\nprepayments and the likelihood that the bonds will be called. Convexity is a \\nbetter risk management tool than duration in volatile interest rate environ\\n-\\nments or when interest rates are low.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nConvexity is only important when comparing two investments with similar \\ndurations.\\nBOND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\\nBond portfolios may be either actively or passively managed to meet the needs \\nof di˜erent investors. Active portfolio management tends to seek an above-\\naverage total return for the portfolio. ˛e portfolio™s total return includes:\\n\\n \\nC\\noupon return: the total of all interest payments received by the portfolio \\nplus accrued interest earned during a speci˚c holding period\\n\\n \\nR\\neinvestment return: the total interest earned from the reinvestment of \\ninterest payments during a speci˚c holding period\\n\\n \\nPr\\nice return: the total of the portfolio™s appreciation or depreciation dur\\n-\\ning a speci˚c holding period\\n', 'CHAPTER 2\\n \\nC\\norporate and Municipal Debt Securities\\n \\n63\\nFor long-term holding periods, the portfolio™s reinvestment return will \\nbe the most important factor when determining the portfolio™s return. For \\nholding periods between two to 10 years, the coupon return and reinvestment \\nreturn will be the most important factors. For short-term holding periods, \\nthe price return will be the most important factor.\\nPassive bond portfolio management includes both indexing and buy-\\nand-hold strategies. Portfolio managers who use indexing try to match the \\nperformance of a given bond index by purchasing bonds that are included \\nin the index. Advantages of indexing include lower management fees, diver\\n-\\nsi˚cation, and more predictable performance. Buy-and-hold managers tend \\nto purchase bonds in the primary market and hold them for long periods of \\ntime or until maturity. By consistently purchasing new issues of bonds, the \\nportfolio manager can maintain diversi˚cation of terms and coupon rates.\\nPension and insurance company portfolio managers o˝en will try to \\nmanage the portfolio™s income to meet the current cash obligations of the pen\\n-\\nsion plan or the insurance company™s guaranteed investment contracts. Two \\nmethods used to match the portfolio™s income with current cash liabilities are \\ndedicated portfolio management and bond immunization. Dedicated port\\n-\\nfolio management matches the portfolio™s monthly income with the monthly \\ncash liabilities. Bond immunization creates a portfolio designed to generate \\na speci˚c return during a known time horizon. Portfolio managers using \\nbond immunization will match the bonds™ maturity dates with the known \\ntime when a lump sum payment is due. Because the portfolio™s maturity \\ndates match the time when the payment is due, the portfolio is said to be \\nimmunized from interest rate risk.\\n', '', '65\\n \\nCHAPTER\\n \\n2\\nPretest\\nCORPORATE AND MUNICIPAL DEBT \\nSECURITIES\\n1.\\n \\nA\\nn investor has purchased 10 corporate bonds at a price of 135.

It is also the issuer with the \\nleast amount of default risk. Default risk is also known as credit risk and is the \\nrisk that the issuer will not be able to meet its obligations under the terms of \\nthe bond in a timely fashion. The U.S. government issues debt securities with \\nmaturities ranging from one month up to 30 years. The Treasury Department \\nissues the securities on behalf of the federal government and they are a \\nlegally binding obligation of the federal government. Interest earned by the \\ninvestors from U.S. government securities is only taxed at the federal level. \\nThe state and local governments do not tax the interest income.\\nSERIES EE BONDS\\n˜e series EE bonds are commonly known as savings bonds. ˜ey are pur\\n-\\nchased directly from the U.S. government at a discount from their face value, \\ntypically 50%. ˜e Series EE bonds pay no semiannual interest and may be \\nredeemed at maturity for the face value. ˜e investor™s interest is earned \\nthrough the bonds™ appreciation toward the face value. ˜e interest earned \\nthrough this appreciation is taxable by the federal government and the inves\\n-\\ntor may pay taxes on this money each year or may wait until the bond matures. \\n˜e investor also may elect to roll the matured Series EE bonds into Series \\nHH bonds and continue to defer taxes.\\n', '70\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSERIES HH BONDS\\nA Series HH bond may only be purchased by trading in matured Series EE \\nbonds. ˜ey may not be purchased for cash.

Series HH bonds may be redeemed at their face value \\nat any time.\\nTREASURY BILLS, NOTES, AND BONDS\\n˜e most widely held U.S. government securities are Treasury bills, notes, \\nand bonds. ˜ese direct obligations of the U.S. government range from one \\nmonth up to 30 years.\\nPURCHASING TREASURY BILLS\\nTreasury bills range in maturity from four to 52 weeks and are auctioned o˚ \\nby the Treasury Department through a weekly competitive auction. Large \\nbanks and broker dealers, known as primary dealers, submit competitive \\nbids or tenders for the bills being sold. ˜e Treasury awards the bills to the \\nbidders who submitted the highest bid and work their way down to lower bids \\nuntil all of the bills are sold. Treasury bills pay no semiannual interest and \\nare issued at a discount from par. ˜e bill appreciates up to par at maturity \\nand the appreciation represents the investor™s interest. Because bills are priced \\nat a discount from par, a higher dollar price represents a lower interest rate \\nfor the purchaser.\\nAll noncompetitive tenders are ˛lled before any competitive tenders are \\n˛lled. A bidder who submits a noncompetitive tender agrees to accept the \\naverage of all the yields accepted by the Treasury and does not try to get the \\nbest yield. All competitive tenders are limited to a maximum amount of \\n$500,000. All bids that are accepted and ˛lled by the Treasury are settled in \\nfed funds. Treasury bills range in denominations from $100 up to $1,000,000.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nA quote for a Treasury bill has a bid that appears to be higher than the o˜er, \\nbut remember that the bills are quoted on a discounted yield basis.

Treasury notes \\nare issued in denominations ranging from $100 up to $1,000,000 and may \\nbe refunded by the government. If a Treasury note is refunded, the govern\\n-\\nment will o˚er the investor a new Treasury note with a new interest rate and \\nmaturity. ˜e investor may always elect to receive their principal payment \\ninstead of accepting the new note.\\nTREASURY BONDS\\nTreasury bonds are the U.S. government™s long-term bonds.

Treasury bonds, like \\nTreasury notes, pay semiannual interest and are issued in denominations \\nranging from $100 up to $1,000,000. Some Treasury bonds may be called in \\nat par by the treasury. If the Treasury Department calls in a bond issue, they \\nmust give holders four months™ notice before calling the bonds.\\nTREASURY BOND AND NOTE PRICING\\nTreasury notes and bonds are quoted as a percentage of par.

A Treasury \\nSTRIP is a zero-coupon bond that is backed by U.S. government securities. \\nAn investor may purchase the principal payment component of $1,000 due \\non a future date at a discount. An investor seeking some current income may \\nwish to purchase the semiannual coupon payments due over the term of the \\nTreasury securities.\\nA STRIP may be purchased by an investor who needs to have a certain \\namount available on a known date in the future (like the time when a child \\nis going to college). By purchasing the STRIP, the investor will be guaranteed \\nto have $1,000 on that date in the future for each STRIP purchased.\\nTREASURY RECEIPTS\\nTreasury receipts are similar to Treasury STRIPs, except that broker deal\\n-\\ners and banks create them. Broker dealers and banks will purchase large \\n', 'CHAPTER 3\\n \\nG\\novernment and Government Agency Issues\\n \\n73\\namounts of Treasury securities, place them in a trust, and sell o˚ the interest \\nand principal payments to di˚erent investors.\\nTREASURY INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES (TIPS)\\nTreasury in˙ation protected securities, or TIPS, o˚er the investor protection \\nfrom in˙ation. ˜e TIPS are sold with a ˛xed interest rate and their principal \\nis adjusted semiannually to re˙ect changes in the consumer price index. Dur\\n-\\ning times of in˙ation, the principal amount of the TIP will be increased and \\nthe investor™s interest payments will rise, while during times of falling prices, \\nthe principal amount of the bond will be adjusted down and the investor will \\nreceive a lower interest payment.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA conservative investor purchases a TIP with a coupon rate of 4%. Prior to \\ntaking in˙ation into consideration the investor will receive 4% \\n˚\\n $1,000 or \\n$40 per year paid $20 or 2% every 6 months. TIPS pay interest every 6 months \\nbased on the adjusted principal amount. If In˙ation is running at 6% per \\n \\nyear over the next 2 years the investor™s principal and interest payments will \\nbe as follows:\\nYear\\nSemiannual AdjustmentAdjusted Principal\\nAdjusted Payment\\n1Number 1\\n$1,030\\n$20.60\\n1Number 1\\n$1,60.90\\n$21.22\\n2Number 2\\n$1,092.73\\n$21.85\\n2Number 2\\n$1,125.51\\n$22.51\\nBecause in˙ation was running at 6% per year the principal was increased \\nby 3% every 6 months. ˜e adjustment to the principal and interests com\\n-\\npounds semiannually and results in the continued increase in the principal \\namount and payment received. To determine the amount of the payment \\ntake half of the coupon rate and multiply it by the adjusted principal. In our \\nexample the TIP paid interest at a rate of 2% of the adjusted principal every \\n6 months. If on your test you cannot remember how to calculate compound \\ninterest over time you may approximate it by simply taking the in˙ation rate \\nover a given period and multiply it by the principal. In our case 6% per year \\nfor two years = 12%. 12% of $1,000 = $120. ˜e adjusted principal would be \\napproximately $1,120. On the exam round up to the next nearest answer as \\nyou can see the approximate method gets you within about $5 of the com\\n-\\npounded principal.\\n', '74\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nBecause the principal amount of the TIP is adjusted every 6 months to \\naccount for in˚ation the real return or the in˚ation adjusted return will \\nalways be equal to the coupon rate. \\nAGENCY ISSUES\\n˜e federal government has authorized certain agencies and certain quasi \\nagencies to issue debt securities that are collectively referred to as agency \\nissues. Revenues generated through taxes, fees, and interest income back \\nthese agency securities. Investors who purchase agency securities are o˚ered \\ninterest rates that generally fall in between the rates o˚ered by similar term \\nTreasury and corporate securities. Investors who purchase agency issues in \\nthe secondary market will be quoted prices for the agency issues that are \\nbased on a percentage of par just like corporate issue.\\nGOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE \\nASSOCIATION (GNMA)\\nThe Government National Mortgage Association often referred to as \\nGinnie Mae is a wholly owned government corporation and is the only \\nagency whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the \\nU.S. government. The purpose of Ginnie Mae is to provide liquidity to \\nthe mortgage markets. Ginnie Mae buys up pools of mortgages that have \\nbeen insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the \\nDepartment of Veteran Affairs (VA). The ownership in these pools of \\nmortgages then is sold off to private investors in the form of pass-through \\ncertificates. Investors in Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates receive \\nmonthly interest and principal payments based on their investment. As \\npeople pay down their mortgages, part of each payment is interest and \\npart of each payment is principal and both portions flow through to \\nthe investor on a monthly basis. The only real risk in owning a Ginnie \\nMae is the risk of early refinancing. As the interest rates in the market\\n-\\nplace fall, people are more likely to refinance their homes and, as a result, \\nthe investor will not receive the higher interest rates for as long as they had \\n', 'CHAPTER 3\\n \\nG\\novernment and Government Agency Issues\\n \\n75\\nhoped. Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates are issued with a minimum \\ndenomination of $1,000 and the interest earned by investors is taxable at \\nall levels: federal, state, and local. Yield quotes on Ginnie Maes are based \\non a 12-year prepayment assumption because most mortgages are repaid \\nearly as a result of refinancing, moving, or a homeowner simply paying \\noff their mortgage.\\nFEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FNM)\\n˜e Federal National Mortgage Association, also known as Fannie Mae, is \\na public for-pro˛t corporation. Fannie Mae™s stock trades publicly and is \\nin business to realize a pro˛t by providing mortgage capital. It™s called an \\nagency security because Fannie Mae has a credit facility with the govern\\n-\\nment and receives certain favorable tax considerations. Fannie Mae pur\\n-\\nchases mortgages and, in turn, packages them to create mortgage-backed \\nsecurities. ˜ese mortgage-backed notes are issued in denominations from \\n$5,000 to $1,000,000 and pay interest semiannually. Fannie Mae also issues \\ndebentures with a minimum denomination of $10,000 that mature in \\nthree to 25 years. Interest is paid semiannually and the interest earned by \\ninvestors from Fannie Mae securities is taxable at all levels: federal, state, \\nand local.\\nFEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE \\nCORPORATION (FHLMC)\\n˜e Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation also known as Freddie Mac \\nis a publicly traded company in business to earn a pro˛t on its loans.

Pools of mortgages on one-\\nfamily to four-family homes collateralize CMOs. Because CMOs are backed \\nby mortgages on real estate, they are considered relatively safe investments \\nand are given a AAA rating. ˜e only real risk that the owner of a CMO faces \\n \\nis the risk of early re˛nance. CMOs pay interest and principal monthly. \\n \\nHowever, they pay the principal to only one tranche at a time in $1,000 pay\\n-\\nments. ˜e CMO pays o˚ each tranche until the ˛nal tranche known as a Z \\ntranche is paid o˚. ˜e Z tranche is the most volatile CMO tranche.\\nCMOs AND INTEREST RATES\\nCMOs, like other interest-bearing investments, will be a˚ected by a change \\nin the interest-rate environment. CMOs may experience the following if \\ninterest rates change:\\n\\n \\nI\\nf interest rates fall, homeowners will re˛nance more quickly and the \\nholder of the CMO will be paid o˚ more quickly than they hoped.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne rate of principal payments may vary.\\n', 'CHAPTER 3\\n \\nG\\novernment and Government Agency Issues\\n \\n77\\n\\n \\nI\\nf interest rates rise, re˛nancing may slow down and the investors will be \\npaid o˚ more slowly than they hoped.\\nMost CMOs have an active secondary market and are considered relatively \\nliquid securities.

Principal-only CMOs receive both \\nthe scheduled principal payments as well as any prepayments made by the \\nhome owners in the pool. Because the principal-only CMO does not receive \\nany interest payments, it is sold at a discount to its face value. ˜e appreciation \\nof the CMO, up to its face value, represents the investor™s return. ˜e price \\nof a principal-only CMO will be sensitive to a change in interest rates.

Interest-only CMOs also will sell at a dis\\n-\\ncount to their face value due to the amortization of the underlying mortgages. \\nInterest-only CMOs will increase in value as interest rates rise and decrease \\nin value as interest rates fall, as a result of the changes in prepayments on \\nthe underlying pool of mortgages. ˜e changes in the prepayments on the \\n', '78\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nunderlying mortgages will a˚ect the number of interest payments the holder \\nof the CMO will receive.

If prepayments \\ncome in too quickly, those principal payments will be deferred to another \\nCMO known as a support class to protect the owner of the PAC from prepay\\n-\\nment risk. If principal payments are made more slowly, principal payments \\nwill be taken from a support class to protect the investor against extension risk.\\nTARGETED AMORTIZATION CLASS (TAC) CMOs\\nTargeted amortization class CMOs only o˚er the investor protection from \\nprepayment risk. If principal payments are made more quickly, they will be \\ntransferred to a support class.

In \\nthis chapter, we will look at how an investment company pools investors™ \\nfunds in order to purchase a diversi˚ed portfolio of securities. It is \\nimperative that all candidates have a complete understanding of how an \\ninvestment company operates. Some of the test focus points will be on:\\n\\n \\nT\\nypes of investment companies\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment company structure\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment company registration\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment company taxation\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment strategies and recommendations\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestor bene˚ts\\nINVESTMENT COMPANY PHILOSOPHY\\nAn investment company is organized as either a corporation or as a trust. \\nIndividual investor™s money then is pooled together in a single account and \\nused to purchase securities that will have the greatest chance of helping the \\ninvestment company reach its objectives. All investors jointly own the port\\n-\\nfolio that is created through these pooled funds and each investor has an \\n', '82\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nundivided interest in the securities. No single shareholder has any right or \\nclaim that exceeds the rights or claims of any other shareholder regardless \\nof the size of the investment. Investment companies o˜er individual inves\\n-\\ntors the opportunity to have their money managed by professionals that may \\notherwise only o˜er their services to large institutions. ˚rough diversi˛ca\\n-\\ntion, the investor may participate in the future growth or income generated \\nfrom the large number of di˜erent securities contained in the portfolio. Both \\ndiversi˛cation and professional management should contribute signi˛cantly \\nto the attainment of the objectives set forth by the investment company. ˚ere \\nare many other features and bene˛ts that may be o˜ered to investors that will \\nbe examined later in this chapter.\\nTYPES OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES\\nAll investment company o˜erings are subject to the Securities Act of 1933 \\nthat requires the investment company to register with the Securities Exchange \\nCommission and to give all purchasers a prospectus. Investment companies \\nalso are all subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 that sets forth \\nguidelines on how investment companies operate. ˚e Investment Company \\nAct of 1940 breaks down investment companies into three di˜erent types:\\n1.\\n \\nF\\nace-amount company (FAC)\\n2.\\n \\nU\\nnit investment trust (UIT)\\n3.\\n \\nM\\nanagement investment company (mutual funds)\\nFACE-AMOUNT COMPANY/\\nFACE-AMOUNT CERTIFICATES\\nAn investor may enter into a contract with an issuer of a face-amount certi˛cate \\nto contract to receive a stated or ˛xed amount of money (the face amount) at \\na stated date in the future. In exchange for this future sum, the investor must \\ndeposit an agreed lump sum or make scheduled installment payments. Face-\\namount certi˛cates are rarely issued today as most of the tax advantages that \\nthe investment once o˜ered have been lost through changes in the tax laws.\\nUNIT INVESTMENT TRUST (UIT)\\nA unit investment trust will invest either in a ˛xed portfolio of securities or \\nin a non˛xed portfolio of securities. A ˛xed UIT traditionally will invest in \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n83\\na large block of government or municipal debt. ˚e bonds will be held until \\nmaturity and the proceeds will be distributed to investors in the UIT. Once the \\nproceeds have been distributed to the investors, the UIT will have achieved its \\nobjective and will cease to exist. A non˛xed UIT will purchase mutual fund \\nshares in order to reach a stated objective. A non˛xed UIT is also known as a \\ncontractual plan. Both types of UITs are organized as a trust and operate as \\na holding company for the portfolio. UITs are not actively managed and they \\ndo not have a board of directors or investment advisers. Both types of UITs \\nissue units or shares of bene˛cial interest to investors which represent as undi\\n-\\nvided interest in the underlying portfolio of securities. UITs must maintain \\na secondary market in the units or shares to o˜er some liquidity to investors.\\nMANAGEMENT INVESTMENT \\nCOMPANIES (MUTUAL FUNDS)\\nA management investment company employs an investment adviser to man\\n-\\nage a diversi˛ed portfolio of securities designed to obtain its stated investment \\nobjective. ˚e management company may be organized as either an open-end \\ncompany or as a closed-end company. ˚e main di˜erence between an open-\\nend company and a closed-end company is how the shares are purchased and \\nsold. An open-end company o˜ers new shares to any investor who wants to \\ninvest. ˚is is known as a continuous primary o˜ering. Because the o˜ering of \\nnew shares is continuous, the capitalization of the open-end fund is unlimited. \\nStated another way, an open-end mutual fund may raise as much money as \\ninvestors are willing to put in. An open-end fund must repurchase its own \\nshares from investors who want to redeem them. ˚ere is no secondary market \\nfor open-end mutual fund shares. ˚e shares must be purchased from the \\nfund company and redeemed to the fund company. A closed-end fund o˜ers \\ncommon shares to investors through an initial public o˜ering (IPO) just like \\na stock. Its capitalization is limited to the number of authorized shares that \\nhave been approved for sale. Shares of the closed-end fund will trade in the \\nsecondary market in investor-to-investor transactions on an exchange or in \\nthe over-the-counter market (OTC), just like common shares.\\nOPEN END VS. CLOSED END\\nAlthough both open-end and closed-end funds are designed to achieve their \\nstated investment objective, the manner in which they operate is di˜erent. \\n˚e following is a side-by-side comparison of the important features of both \\n', '84\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nopen-end and closed-end funds and shows how those features di˜er between \\nthe fund types.\\nFeature\\nOpen End\\nClosed End\\nCapitalization\\nUnlimited continuous \\nprimary o˜ering\\nSingle ˚xed o˜ering through \\nIPO\\nInvestor may purchase\\nFull and fractional sharesFull shares only\\nSecurities o˜ered\\nCommon shares only\\nCommon and preferred \\nshares and debt securities\\nShares purchased and \\nsold\\nShares purchased from \\nthe fund company and \\nredeemed to the fund \\ncompany\\nShares may be purchased \\nonly from the fund company \\nduring IPO, then secondary \\nmarket transactions between \\ninvestors\\nShare pricing\\nShares priced by formula \\nNAV \\n˜\\n SC \\n˚\\n POP\\nShares priced by supply and \\ndemand\\nShareholder rights\\nDividends and votingDividends, voting, and \\npreemptive\\nDIVERSIFIED VS. NONDIVERSIFIED\\nInvestors in a mutual fund will achieve diversi˛cation through their invest\\n-\\nment in the fund. However, in order to determine if the fund itself is a diversi\\n-\\n˛ed fund, the fund must meet certain requirements. ˚e Investment Company \\nAct of 1940 laid out an asset allocation model that must be followed in order \\nfor the fund to call itself a diversi˛ed mutual fund. It is known as the 75-5-10 \\ntest and the requirements are as follows:\\n75%:\\n 75% of the fund™s assets must be invested in securities of other issu\\n-\\ners. Cash and cash equivalents are counted as part of the 75%. A cash \\nequivalent may be a T-bill or a money market instrument.\\n5%:\\n ˚e investment company may not invest more than 5% of its assets \\nin any one company.\\n10%:\\n ˚e investment company may not own more than 10% of any com\\n-\\npany™s outstanding voting stock.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nXYZ fund markets itself as a diversi˛ed mutual fund. It has $10,000,000,000 \\nin net assets and the investment adviser thinks that the ABC Company would \\nbe a great company to acquire for $300,000,000. Since XYZ markets itself as a \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n85\\ndiversi˛ed mutual fund, they would not be allowed to purchase the company \\neven though the price of $300,000,000 would be less than 5% of the fund™s \\nassets. ˚e investment company must meet both the diversi˛cation require\\n-\\nments of 5% of assets and 10% of ownership in order to continue to market \\nitself as a diversi˛ed mutual fund.\\nINVESTMENT COMPANY REGISTRATION\\nInvestment companies are regulated by both the Securities Act of 1933 and \\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940. An investment company must reg\\n-\\nister with the SEC if the company operates to own, invest, reinvest, or trade \\nin securities. A company also must register with the SEC as an investment \\ncompany if the company has 40% or more of its assets invested in securities \\nother than those issued by the U.S. government or one of the company™s \\nsubsidiaries.\\nREGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS\\nBefore an investment company may register with the SEC, it must meet certain \\nminimum requirements. An investment company may not register with the \\nSEC unless it has the following:\\n\\n \\nM\\ninimum net worth of $100,000\\n\\n \\nA\\nt least 100 shareholders\\n\\n \\nC\\nlearly de˛ned investment objectives\\nAn investment company may be allowed to register without having 100 \\nshareholders and without a net worth of $100,000 if it can meet these require\\n-\\nments within 90 days.\\nInvestment companies must ˛le a full registration with the SEC before \\nthe o˜ering becomes e˜ective. ˚e investment company is considered to have \\nregistered when the SEC receives its notice of registration. ˚e investment \\ncompany™s registration statement must contain:\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of investment company (open-end, closed-end, etc.)\\n\\n \\nB\\niographical information on the o˝cers and directors of the company\\n\\n \\nN\\name and address of each a˝liated person\\n', '86\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\nP\\nlans to concentrate investments in any one area (i.e., sector fund)\\n\\n \\nP\\nlans to invest in real estate or commodities\\n\\n \\nB\\norrowing plans\\n\\n \\nC\\nonditions under which investment objective may be changed through \\na vote of shareholders\\nOnce registered, the investment company may:\\n\\n \\nR\\naise money through the sale of shares\\n\\n \\nL\\nend money to earn interest\\n\\n \\nB\\norrow money on a limited basis\\nAn investment company obtains its investment capital from shareholders \\nthrough the sale of shares. Once it™s operating, it may lend money to earn \\ninterest such as by purchasing bonds or notes. An investment company, \\nhowever, may not lend money to employees. An investment company may \\nborrow money for such business purposes as to redeem shares. If the invest\\n-\\nment company borrows money, it must have $3 in equity for every dollar \\nthat it wants to borrow. Another way of saying that is that the investment \\ncompany must maintain an asset-to-debt ratio of at least three-to-one or of \\nat least 300%.\\nAn investment company is prohibited from:\\n\\n \\nT\\naking over or controlling other companies\\n\\n \\nA\\ncting as a bank or a savings and loan\\n\\n \\nR\\neceiving commission for executing orders or for acting as a broker\\n\\n \\nC\\nontinuing to operate with less than 100 shareholders or less than \\n$100,000 net worth\\nUnless the investment company meets strict capital and disclosure \\nrequirements, it may not engage in any of the following:\\n\\n \\nS\\nelling securities short\\n\\n \\nB\\nuying securities on margin\\n\\n \\nM\\naintaining joint accounts\\n\\n \\nD\\nistributing its own shares\\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n87\\nRegardless of the makeup of their investment holdings, all of the following \\nare exempt from the registration requirements of an investment company:\\n\\n \\nBr\\noker dealers\\n\\n \\nU\\nnderwriters\\n\\n \\nBa\\nnks and savings and loans\\n\\n \\nM\\nortgage companies\\n\\n \\nR\\neal estate investment trusts (REITs)\\n\\n \\nS\\necurity holder protection committees\\nINVESTMENT COMPANY COMPONENTS\\nInvestment companies have several di˜erent groups that serve specialized \\nfunctions.

A noninterested person is a person whose only \\na˝liation with the fund is as a member of the board. ˚erefore, a maximum \\nof 49% of the board may hold another position within the fund company or \\nmay otherwise be interested in the fund. An a˝liated person is anyone who \\ncould exercise control over the company, such as an accountant. An a˝liated \\nperson may also include:\\n\\n \\nBr\\noker dealer\\n\\n \\nAt\\ntorney\\n\\n \\nI\\nmmediate family of an a˝liated person\\n\\n \\nA\\nnyone else the SEC designates\\nBoth a˝liated and interested parties are prohibited from selling securities \\nor property to the investment company or any of its subsidiaries. Anyone who \\nhas been convicted of any felony or securities-related misdemeanor or who has \\nbeen barred from the securities business may not serve on the board of directors.\\nBONDING OF KEY EMPLOYEES\\n˚e investment company is required to obtain a bond to cover itself and \\neach o˝cer, director, and employee with access to the investment company™s \\nassets. ˚e company may obtain a bond for each employee or may obtain a \\nblanket bond for all employees that are required to be bonded. In the case \\nof a blanket bond, the company must list the names of the employees to be \\ncovered. ˚e bond only covers the employees for negligence. Any criminal \\nacts or acts of bad faith are not covered.\\nINVESTMENT ADVISER\\n˚e investment company™s board of directors hires the investment adviser \\nto manage the fund™s portfolio. ˚e investment adviser is a company, not a \\nperson, which must also determine the tax consequences of distributions to \\nshareholders and ensure that the investment strategies are in line with the \\nfund™s stated investment objectives. ˚e investment adviser™s compensation \\nis a percentage of the net assets of the fund, not a percentage of the pro˛ts, \\nalthough performance bonuses are allowed. ˚e investment adviser™s fee is \\ntypically the largest expense of the fund and the more aggressive the objec\\n-\\ntive, the higher the fee. ˚e investment adviser may not borrow from the fund \\nand may not have any security-related convictions.\\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n89\\nCUSTODIAN BANK\\n˚e custodian bank or the exchange member broker dealer that has been hired \\nby the investment company physically holds all of the fund™s cash and securi\\n-\\nties. ˚e custodian holds all of the fund™s assets for safekeeping and provides \\nother bookkeeping and clerical functions for the investment company, such \\nas maintaining books and records for accumulation plans for investors.

Growth funds seek capital \\ngains and do not produce signi˛cant dividend income.\\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n93\\nEQUITY INCOME FUND\\nAn equity income fund will purchase both common and preferred shares that \\nhave a long track record of paying consistent dividends. Preferred shares are \\npurchased by the fund for their stated dividend. Utility stocks also are pur\\n-\\nchased because utilities traditionally pay out the highest percentage of their \\nearnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. Other common shares of \\nblue-chip companies also may be purchased.\\nSECTOR FUNDS\\nMutual funds that concentrate 25% or more of their assets in one business \\narea or region are known as sector funds. Technology, biotech, and gold funds \\nwould all be examples of sector funds that concentrate their investments in \\none business area. A northeast growth fund would be an example of a sector \\nfund that concentrates its assets geographically. Sector funds traditionally \\ncarry higher risk reward ratios. If the sector does well, the investor may enjoy \\na higher rate of return. If, however, the sector performs poorly, the inves\\n-\\ntor may su˜er larger losses. ˚e high-risk reward ratio is due to the funds \\nconcentration in one area.\\nINDEX FUNDS\\nAn index fund is designed to mirror the performance of a large market index \\nsuch as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. An index fund™s \\nportfolio is comprised of the stocks that are included in the index that the \\nfund is designed to track. ˚e fund manager does not actively seek out which \\nstocks to buy or sell, making an index fund an example of a fund that is pas\\n-\\nsively managed. If the stock is in the index, it will usually be in the portfolio. \\nPortfolio turnover for an index fund is generally low, which helps keep the \\nfund™s expenses down.\\nGROWTH AND INCOME (COMBINATION FUND)\\nA growth and income fund, as the name suggests, invests to achieve both \\ncapital appreciation and current income. ˚e fund will invest a portion of its \\nassets in shares of common stock that o˜er the greatest appreciation potential \\nand will invest a portion of its assets in preferred and common shares that \\npay high dividends, in order to produce income for investors.\\n', '94\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nBALANCED FUNDS\\nA balanced fund invests in both stocks and bonds, according to a predeter\\n-\\nmined formula. For example, the fund may invest 70% of its assets in equities \\nand 30% of its assets in bonds.\\nASSET ALLOCATION FUNDS\\nAsset allocation funds invest in stocks, bonds, and money market instru\\n-\\nments, according to the expected performance for each market. For example, \\nif the portfolio manager feels that equities will do well, they may invest more \\nmoney in equities. Alternatively, if they feel that the bond market will out\\n-\\nperform equities, they may shi˙ more money into the debt markets.\\nOTHER TYPES OF FUNDS\\n˚ere are other types of equity funds, such as foreign stock funds that invest \\noutside the United States, and special situation funds that invest in takeover \\ncandidates and restructuring companies. A ˛nal type of fund is an option \\nincome fund that purchases shares of common stock and sells call options \\nagainst the portfolio in order to generate premium income for investors. \\nBecause the fund has sold call options on the shares it owns, it will limit the \\ncapital appreciation of the portfolio.\\nBOND FUNDS\\nInvestors who invest in bond funds are actually purchasing an equity secu\\n-\\nrity that represents their undivided interest in a portfolio of debt. Corpora\\n-\\ntions, U.S. government, or state and local municipalities may have issued \\nthe debt in the portfolio. Bond funds invest mainly to generate current \\nincome for investors through interest payments generated by the bonds in \\nthe portfolio.\\nCORPORATE BOND FUNDS\\nCorporate bond funds invest in debt securities that have been issued by cor\\n-\\nporations. ˚e debt in the portfolio could be investment grade or it could \\nbe speculative, such as in a high-yield or junk-bond fund. Dividend income \\nthat is generated by the portfolio™s interest payments is subject to all taxes.\\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n95\\nGOVERNMENT BOND FUNDS\\nGovernment bond funds invest in debt securities issued by the U.S. govern\\n-\\nment such as Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Many funds also invest in the \\ndebt of government agencies such as those issued by the Government National \\nMortgage Association also known as Ginnie Mae. Government bond funds \\nprovide current income to investors, along with a high degree of safety of \\nprincipal. Dividends based upon the interest payments received from direct \\ntreasury obligations are only subject to federal taxation.\\nMUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS\\nMunicipal bond funds invest in portfolios of municipal debt. Investors in \\nmunicipal bond funds receive dividend income, which is free from federal \\ntaxes because the dividends are based on the interest payments received from \\nthe municipal bonds in the portfolio. Investors are still subject to taxes for \\nany capital gains distributions or for any capital gains realized through the \\nsale of the mutual fund shares.\\nMONEY MARKET FUNDS\\nMoney market funds invest in short-term money market instruments such \\nas banker™s acceptances, commercial paper, and other debt securities with \\nless than one year remaining to maturity. Money market funds are no-load \\nfunds that o˜er the investor the highest degree of safety of principal along \\nwith current income. ˚e NAV for money market funds is always equal to $1, \\nhowever, this is not guaranteed. Investors use money market funds as a place \\nto hold idle funds and to earn current income. Interest is earned by investors \\ndaily and is credited to their accounts monthly. Most money market funds \\no˜er check writing privileges and investors must receive a prospectus prior \\nto investing or opening an account.\\nMONEY MARKET GUIDELINES\\nMoney market funds must adhere to certain guidelines in order to qualify \\nas a money market fund, such as:\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne prospectus must clearly state on its cover that the fund is not insured \\nor guaranteed by the U.S. government and that the fund™s net asset value \\nmay fall below $1.\\n\\n \\nS\\necurities in the portfolio may have a maximum maturity of 13 months.\\n', '96\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne average maturity for securities in the portfolio may not exceed 90 days.\\n\\n \\nN\\no more than 5% of the fund™s assets may be invested in any one issuer™s \\ndebt securities.\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestments are limited to the top two ratings awarded by a nationally \\nrecognized ratings agency, i.e., S&P and Moody™s.\\n\\n \\n9\\n5% of the portfolio must be in the top ratings category with no more \\nthan 5% being invested in the second tier.\\nALTERNATIVE FUNDS\\nAlternative funds, also known as alt funds or liquid alts, invest in nontradi\\n-\\ntional assets or illiquid assets and may employ alternative investment strate\\n-\\ngies. ˚ere is no standard de˛nition for what constitutes an alt fund, but alt \\nfunds are o˙en marketed as a way for retail investors to gain access to hedge \\nfunds and actively managed programs that will perform well in a variety of \\nmarket conditions. ˚ese funds claim to reduce volatility, increase diversi˛ca\\n-\\ntion, and produce higher returns when compared to long-only equity funds \\nand income funds while still providing liquidity. Recommendations for alt \\nfunds must be based on the speci˛c strategies employed by the fund, not \\nmerely as one overall investment. Retail communication must accurately and \\nfairly detail each fund™s operations and objectives in line with the informa\\n-\\ntion in the prospectuses. A signi˛cant concern is that investment advisers \\nand retail investors will not understand how these funds will react in certain \\nmarket conditions or how the fund manager will approach those market \\nconditions. ˚ese funds must be reviewed during the new product review \\nprocess even if the ˛rm has a selling agreement with the fund.\\nVALUING MUTUAL FUND SHARES\\nMutual funds must determine the net asset value of the fund™s shares at least \\nonce per business day. Most mutual funds will price their shares at the close \\nof business of the NYSE (4:00 \\nˆˇ\\n EST). ˚e mutual fund prospectus will \\nprovide the best answer as to when the fund calculates the price of its shares. \\n˚e calculation is required to determine both the redemption price and the \\npurchase price of the fund™s shares. ˚e price, which is received by an inves\\n-\\ntor who is redeeming shares, and the price that is paid by an investor who is \\npurchasing shares, will be based upon the price, which is next calculated a˙er \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n97\\nthe fund has received the investor™s order. ˚is is known as forward pricing. \\nTo calculate the fund™s NAV, use the following formula:\\nAssets Œ liabilities \\n˚\\n net asset value\\nTo determine the NAV per share, simply divide the total net asset value \\nby the total number of outstanding shares.\\nTotal NAV \\nTotal no. of shares\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nIf XYZ mutual fund has $10,000,000 in assets and $500,000 in liabilities, \\nwhat is the fund™s NAV?\\nAssets \\n˛\\n liabilities \\n˚\\n NAV\\n$10,000,000\\n˝˛˝\\n$500,000 \\n˚\\n $9,500,000\\nIf XYZ has 1,000,000 shares outstanding, its NAV per share would be:\\nTotal NAV\\n$9,500,000\\nTotal no. of shares\\n1,000,000\\nNAV per share \\n˚\\n $9.50\\nCHANGES IN THE NAV\\n˚e net asset value of a mutual fund is constantly changing as security prices \\n˘uctuate and as the mutual fund conducts its business. ˚e following illus\\n-\\ntrates how the NAV per share will be a˜ected given certain events.\\nINCREASES IN THE NAV\\n˚e net asset value of the mutual fund will increase if the:\\n\\n \\nV\\nalue of the securities in the portfolio increase\\n\\n \\nP\\nortfolio receives investment income, such as interest payments from bonds\\n', '98\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nDECREASES IN THE NAV\\n˚e net asset value will decrease if the:\\n\\n \\nV\\nalue of the securities in the portfolio fall in value\\n\\n \\nF\\nund distributes dividends or capital gains\\nNO EFFECT ON THE NAV\\n˚e following will have no e˜ect on the net asset value of the mutual fund \\nshare:\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestor purchases and redemptions\\n\\n \\nP\\nortfolio purchases and sales of securities\\n\\n \\nS\\nales charges\\nSALES CHARGES\\n˚e maximum allowable sales charge that an open-end fund may charge is \\n8.5% of the POP. ˚e sales charge that may be assessed by a particular fund \\nwill be detailed in the fund™s prospectus.

An investor who \\nwants to purchase a closed-end fund will pay the current market price plus \\nthe commission their brokerage ˛rm charges them to execute the order.\\nEXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFs)\\nIn recent years, exchange-traded funds or ETFs have gained a lot of popu\\n-\\nlarity. ETFs are created through the purchase of a basket of securities that \\nare designed to track the performance of an index or sector. ETFs are not \\nactively managed; provide investors with lower costs; and the ability to buy, \\nsell, and sell short the ETF at any point during the trading day, and may be \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n99\\npurchased on margin. Certain types of ETFs are designed to provide returns \\nand performance characteristics of positions that take on the leverage. Such \\nETFs are o˙en known as ﬁultraﬂ or double ETFs. ˚ese ETFs may provide \\nreturns that are double or more of the return of an index, or double or more \\nthe inverse return of an index.\\nETFs THAT TRACK ALTERNATIVELY \\nWEIGHTED INDICES\\nInvesting in ETFs that track indices has become a popular investment strat\\n-\\negy. As a result, new products have come to market that track the performance \\nof alternative indices. Equally weighted, alternatively weighted, fundamen\\n-\\ntally weighted, and volatility weighted ETFs o˜er exposure to other invest\\n-\\nment styles and may provide enhanced performance. ˚ese ETFs present \\nadditional risk factors that both investment advisers and investors need to \\nunderstand. ˚ese funds are sometimes marketed as having better perfor\\n-\\nmance than other indices, which could be cause for concern as the ETFs that \\ntrack these indices may be complex, thinly traded, and hard to understand \\nfor both advisers and retail investors. ˚e lack of liquidity can lead to wider \\nspreads causing the product to be expensive to buy and sell for investors. ˚e \\nportfolios o˙en have high turnover, which can lead to increased transaction \\ncosts for ETF.\\nFRONT-END LOADS\\nA front-end load is a sales charge that the investor pays when they purchase \\nshares. ˚e sales charge is added to the NAV of the fund and the investor \\npurchases the shares at the POP. ˚e sales charge, in essence, is deducted \\nfrom the gross amount invested and the remaining amount is invested in \\nthe portfolio at the NAV.

Shares, which charge an asset-based fee and a back-end load, \\nare known as ﬁDﬂ shares.\\nRECOMMENDING MUTUAL FUNDS\\nMutual funds are designed to be longer-term investments and are generally \\nnot used to time the market. When determining suitability for investors, \\nthe investment advisers must ˛rst make sure that the investment objective \\nof the mutual fund matches the investor™s objective. Once several funds \\nhave been selected that meet the client™s objective, the adviser must then \\ncompare costs, fees, and expenses among the funds. Priority should be given \\nto any fund company with whom the investor maintains an investment. If \\nthe client™s objective has changed then fund most likely o˜ers conversion \\n \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n101\\nprivileges that will allow the investor to move into another portfolio with\\n-\\nout paying any sales charge. If the investor is committing new capital then \\nthe fund company most likely o˜ers combination privileges and rights of \\naccumulation, which will help the investor reach a sale charge reduction. \\nSwitching fund companies and/or spreading out investment dollars among \\ndi˜erent fund companies are red ˘ags for breakpoint sales violations and \\nabusive sales practices. ˚e amount of time the investor is seeking to hold \\n \\nthe investment will be a determining factor as to which share class is the \\n \\nmost appropriate. Investors who have longer holding periods may be better \\no˜ in B shares that assess a sales charge upon redemption based on their \\nholding period. Investors who have shorter time horizons will be better of \\nchoosing A shares over B shares as the expenses associated with B shares \\n \\ntend to be higher. Important to note is that making a large investment in \\nclass B shares is a red ˘ag for a breakpoint sales violation as the large dollar \\namount would have most likely resulted in a reduced sales charge for the \\ninvestors. Investors with relatively short holding periods or who want to \\nactively move money between funds to try to time the market would be best \\no˜ with C shares that charge a level load each year.\\nCALCULATING A MUTUAL FUND™S \\nSALES CHARGE PERCENTAGE\\n˚ere are many times when an investor may know only the NAV and the POP \\nfor a given mutual fund and not the sales charge percentage that is charged \\nby the fund.

Breakpoint sales charge reductions are available to \\nany person including corporations, trusts, couples, and accounts for minors. \\nBreakpoint sales charge reductions are not available to investment clubs or to \\nparents and their adult children investing in separate accounts. ˚e follow\\n-\\ning is an example of a breakpoint schedule that a family of funds might use:\\nDollar Amount Invested\\nSales Charge\\n$1Œ$24,999\\n8.5%\\n$25,000Œ$74,999\\n7%\\n$75,000Œ$149,999\\n5%\\n$150,000Œ$499,999\\n3%\\n$500,000 or greater\\n1%\\nA breakpoint schedule bene˛ts all parties, the fund company, the inves\\n-\\ntor, and the representative.\\nLETTER OF INTENT\\nAn investor who might not be able to reach a breakpoint with a single pur\\n-\\nchase may qualify for a breakpoint sales charge reduction by signing a letter \\nof intent. A letter of intent will give the investor up to 13 months to reach \\nthe dollar amount to which they subscribed. ˚e letter of intent is binding \\nonly on the fund company, not on the investor. ˚e additional shares that \\nwill be purchased as a result of the lower sales charge will be held by the fund \\ncompany in an escrow account. If the investor ful˛lls the letter of intent, the \\nshares are released to them. Should the investor fail to reach the breakpoint \\nto which they subscribed, they will be charged an adjustment to their sales \\ncharge. ˚e investor may choose to pay the adjusted sales charge by either \\nsending a check or by allowing some of the escrowed shares to be liquidated.\\nBACKDATING A LETTER OF INTENT\\nAn investor may backdate a letter of intent up to 90 days to include a prior \\npurchase and the 13-month window starts from the back date. For exam\\n-\\nple, if an investor backdates a letter of intent by the maximum of 90 days \\nallowed, then the investor has only 10 months to complete the letter of intent.\\n', '104\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nBREAKPOINT SALES\\nA breakpoint sale is a violation committed by a registered representative \\nwho is trying to earn larger commissions by recommending the purchase of \\nmutual fund shares in a dollar amount that is just below the breakpoint that \\nwould allow the investor to qualify for a reduced sales charge. A breakpoint \\nviolation also may be considered to have been committed if a representative \\nspreads out a large sum of money over di˜erent families of funds. A registered \\nrepresentative must always notify an investor of the availability of a sales \\ncharge reduction, especially when the investor is depositing a sum of money \\nthat is close to the breakpoint.\\nRIGHTS OF ACCUMULATION\\nRights of accumulation allow the investor to qualify for reduced sales charges \\non subsequent investments by taking into consideration the value of the \\ninvestor™s account, including the growth. Unlike a letter of intent, there is no \\ntime limit and, as the investor™s account grows over time, they can qualify \\nfor lower sales charges on future investments. ˚e sales charge reduction is \\nnot retroactive and does not reduce the sales charges on prior purchases. \\nTo qualify for the breakpoint, the dollar amount of the current purchase is \\ncalculated into the total value of the investor™s account.\\n TEST\\nFOCUS!\\n \\nUsing the earlier breakpoint schedule, let™s look at an investor™s account \\nover the last three years:\\nDeposit\\nSales Charge\\nYear 1\\n$5,000\\n8.5%\\nYear 2\\n$5,000\\n8.5%\\nYear 3\\n$5,000\\n8.5%\\nLet™s assume that the investor™s account has increased in value by \\n$6,000, making the total current value of the account $21,000. The investor \\nhas another $5,000 to invest this year and, because there is a sales charge \\nreduction available at the $25,000 level, based on the breakpoint schedule \\non page 103, the investor will pay a sales charge of 7% on the new $5,000.\\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n105\\nAUTOMATIC REINVESTMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS\\nInvestors may elect to have their distributions automatically reinvested in the \\nfund and use the distributions to purchase more shares. Most mutual funds \\nwill allow the investor to purchase the shares at the NAV when they reinvest \\ndistributions. ˚is feature has to be o˜ered by mutual funds charging a sales \\ncharge of 8.5%. However, it is o˜ered by most other mutual funds as well.\\nOTHER MUTUAL FUND FEATURES\\nCOMBINATION PRIVILEGES\\nMost mutual fund companies o˜er a variety of portfolios to meet di˜erent \\ninvestment objectives. ˚e di˜erent portfolios become known as a family of \\nfunds. Combination privileges allow an investor to combine the simultane\\n-\\nous purchases of two di˜erent portfolios to reach a breakpoint sales charge \\nreduction.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor purchases $15,000 worth of an income fund and, at the same time, \\ninvests $40,000 into a growth portfolio o˜ered by the same fund company. \\nIf the fund company o˜ers a breakpoint sales charge reduction at $50,000, \\nthe investor would qualify for the lower sales charge under combination \\nprivileges.\\nCONVERSION OR EXCHANGE PRIVILEGES\\nMost mutual fund families will o˜er its investors conversion or exchange \\nprivileges that allow the investor to move money from one portfolio to another \\no˜ered by the same fund company without paying another sales charge. \\nAnother way of looking at this is that the fund company allows the investor \\nto redeem the shares of one portfolio at the NAV and use the proceeds to pur\\n-\\nchase shares of another portfolio at the NAV. ˚e IRS sees this as a purchase \\nand a sale and the investor will have to pay taxes on any gain on the sale of \\nportfolio shares. Other exchange conditions are as follows:\\n\\n \\nD\\nollar value of purchase may not exceed sales proceeds\\n\\n \\nP\\nurchase of new portfolio must occur within 30 days\\n\\n \\nS\\nale may not include a sales charge refund\\n\\n \\nN\\no commission may be paid to a registered representative of broker dealer\\n', '106\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n \\nFOCUS\\nPOINT\\n \\nAn aggressive investor has $20,000 invested in the ABC high-growth fund \\nthat has an NAV of $12 and a POP of $12.60.

If the investor needs to liquidate mutual \\nfund shares for emergency purposes, the investor will be able to reinvest an \\nequal sum of money at the portfolio™s NAV if they reinvest the money within \\n30 days. ˚is is usually a one-time privilege and the NAV used to purchase \\nthe shares is the NAV on the day of the reinvestment.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nIf a client redeems their shares within seven business days of purchase, the \\nsales charge earned by the broker dealer and the representative is returned \\nto the fund company.\\nDOLLAR COST AVERAGING\\nOne of the more popular methods to accumulate mutual fund shares is \\nthrough a process known as dollar cost averaging. An investor purchases \\nmutual fund shares through regularly scheduled investments of a ˛xed dol\\n-\\nlar amount. An investor may elect to invest $100 a month into a mutual \\n', 'CHAPTER 4\\n \\nI\\nnvestment Companies\\n \\n107\\nfund by having the fund company debit their checking account. As the \\nshare price of the mutual fund ˘uctuates, the investor™s $100 investment \\nwill purchase fewer shares when the market price of the mutual fund share \\nis high and will purchase more shares when the market price is low. As \\n \\nthe market price of the mutual fund share continues to ˘uctuate over time, \\nthe investor™s average cost per share should always be lower than their average \\nprice per share, allowing the investor to liquidate the shares at a pro˛t. Dollar \\ncost averaging does not, however, guarantee a pro˛t because a mutual fund \\nshare could continue to decline until the share price hits zero.

The result is an average cost per \\nshare that is signi˚cantly lower than the investor™s average price per \\nshare. The change in the mutual fund share price is more dramatic than \\nwill usually be experienced in real life and the investor would normally \\nhave to invest in the fund for a longer period of time before achieving \\nsimilar results.\\nMUTUAL FUNDS VOTING RIGHTS\\nMutual fund investors have the right to vote on major issues regarding the \\nfund. All votes are won by a simple majority; that is, 51% of the outstanding \\nshares will win the vote. It is important to distinguish that shares vote, not \\nshareholders. An investor with 5,000 shares has ˛ve times as many votes as an \\ninvestor with 1,000 shares, even though they are both shareholders.

For most people, saving for retirement \\nhas become an important investment objective for at least part of their \\nportfolio. Many investors choose to purchase annuities to help plan for \\nretirement. Over the years a wide range of annuity products have been \\ndeveloped to meet di˜erent investment objectives and risk pro˚les. \\nCandidates will need to fully understand how annuities and retirement \\nplans function in order to successfully complete the exam.\\nANNUITIES\\nAn annuity is a contract between an individual and an insurance company. \\nOnce the contract is entered into, the individual becomes known as the \\nannuitant. ˜ere are three basic types of annuities that are deigned to meet \\ndi˚erent objectives. ˜ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nF\\nixed annuity\\n2.\\n \\nV\\nariable annuity\\n3.\\n \\nC\\nombination annuity\\nAlthough all three types allow the investor™s money to grow tax deferred, \\nthe type of investments made and how the money is invested varies according \\nto the type of annuity.\\n', '116\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nFIXED ANNUITY\\nA ˛xed annuity o˚ers investors a guaranteed rate of return regardless of \\nwhether the investment portfolio can produce the guaranteed rate. If the \\nperformance of the portfolio falls below the rate that was guaranteed, the \\ninsurance company owes investors the di˚erence. Because the purchaser of a \\n˛xed annuity does not have any investment risk, a ˛xed annuity is considered \\nto be an insurance product, not a security. Representatives who sell ˛xed \\nannuity contracts must have an insurance license. Because ˛xed annuities \\no˚er investors a guaranteed return, the money invested by the insurance \\ncompany will be used to purchase conservative investments like mortgages \\nand real estate. ˜ese are investments whose historical performance is pre\\n-\\ndictable enough so that a guaranteed rate can be o˚ered to investors. All \\nof the money invested into ˛xed annuity contracts is held in the insurance \\ncompany™s general account. Because the rate that the insurance company \\nguarantees is not very high, the annuitant may su˚er a loss of purchasing \\npower due to in˝ation risk.\\nVARIABLE ANNUITY\\nAn investor seeking to achieve a higher rate of return may elect to purchase \\na variable annuity. Variable annuities seek to obtain a higher rate of return \\nby investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual fund shares. ˜ese securities tradi\\n-\\ntionally o˚er higher rates of return than more conservative investments. A \\nvariable annuity does not o˚er the investor a guaranteed rate of return and \\nthe investor may lose all or part of their principal. Because the annuitant \\nbears the investment risk associated with a variable annuity, the contract is \\nconsidered to be both a security and an insurance product. Representatives \\nwho sell variable annuities must have both their securities license and their \\ninsurance license. ˜e money and securities contained in a variable annuity \\ncontract are held in the insurance company™s separate account. ˜e separate \\naccount was named this because the variable annuity™s portfolio must be \\nkept separate from the insurance company™s general funds. ˜e insurance \\ncompany must have a net worth of $1,000,000, or the separate account must \\nhave a net worth of $1,000,000, in order for the separate account to begin \\noperating. Once the separate account begins operations, it may invest in one \\nof two ways:\\n1.\\n \\nD\\nirectly\\n2.\\n \\nI\\nndirectly\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n117\\nDIRECT INVESTMENT\\nIf the money in the separate account is invested directly into individual stocks \\nand bonds, the separate account must have an investment adviser to actively \\nmanage the portfolio. If the money in the separate account is actively man\\n-\\naged and invested directly, then the separate account is considered to be an \\nopen-end investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 \\nand must register as such.\\nINDIRECT INVESTMENT\\nIf the separate account uses the money in the portfolio to purchase mutual \\nfund shares, it is investing in the equity and debt markets indirectly and \\nno investment adviser is required to actively manage the portfolio. If the \\nseparate account purchases mutual fund shares, then the separate account \\nis considered to be a unit investment trust under the Investment Company \\nAct of 1940 and must register as such.\\nCOMBINATION ANNUITY\\nFor investors who feel that a ˛xed annuity is too conservative and that a variable \\nannuity is too risky, a combination annuity o˚ers the annuitant features of both \\na ˛xed and variable contract. A combination annuity has a ˛xed portion that \\no˚ers a guaranteed rate and a variable portion that tries to achieve a higher rate \\nof return. Most combination annuities will allow the investor to move money \\nbetween the ˛xed and variable portions of the contract. ˜e money invested in \\nthe ˛xed portion of the contract is invested in the insurance company™s general \\naccount and used to purchase conservative investments like mortgages and real \\nestate. ˜e money invested in the variable side of the contract is invested in \\nthe insurance company™s separate account and used to purchase stocks, bonds, \\nor mutual fund shares. Representatives who sell combination annuities must \\nhave both their securities license and their insurance license.\\nBONUS ANNUITY\\nAn insurance company that issues annuity contracts may o˚er incentives to \\ninvestors who purchase their variable annuities. Such incentives are o˙en referred \\nto as bonuses. One type of bonus is known as premium enhancement. Under \\na premium enhancement option, the insurance company will make an addi\\n-\\ntional contribution to the annuitant™s account based on the premium paid by the \\nannuitant. For example, if the annuitant is contributing $1,000 per month, the \\n', '118\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\ninsurance company may o˚er to contribute an additional 5% or $50 per month to \\nthe account. Another type of bonus o˚ered to annuitants is the ability to withdraw \\nthe greater of the account™s earnings or up to 15% of the total premiums paid \\nwithout a penalty. Although the annuitant will not have to pay a penalty to the \\ninsurance company, there may be income taxes and a 10% penalty tax owed to \\nthe IRS. Bonus annuities o˙en have higher expenses and longer surrender periods \\nthan other annuities and these additional costs and surrender periods need to be \\nclearly disclosed to perspective purchasers. In order to o˚er bonus annuities the \\nbonus received must outweigh the increased costs and fees associated with the \\ncontract. Fixed annuity contracts may not o˚er bonuses to purchasers.\\nEQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITY\\nEquity-indexed annuities o˚er investors a return that varies according to the \\nperformance of a set index such as the S&P 500. Equity-indexed annuities \\nwill credit additional interest to the investor™s account based on the contract™s \\nparticipation rate. If a contract sets the participation rate at 70% of the return \\nfor the S&P 500 index, and the index returns 5%, then the investor™s account \\nwill be credited for 70% of the return or 3.5%. ˜e participation rate may \\nalso be shown as a spread rate. If the contract had a spread rate of 3% and \\nthe index returned 10%, then the investor™s contract would be credited 7%. \\nEquity-indexed annuities may also set a ˝oor rate and a cap rate for the con\\n-\\ntract. ˜e ˝oor rate is the minimum interest rate that will be credited to the \\ninvestor™s account. ˜e ˝oor rate may be zero or it may be a positive number, \\ndepending on the speci˛c contract. ˜e contract™s cap rate is the maximum \\nrate that will be credited to the contract. If the return of the index exceeds \\nthe cap rate, the investor™s account will only be credited up to the cap rate. \\nIf the S&P 500 index returns 11% and the cap rate set in the contract is 9%, \\nthen the investor™s account will only be credited 9%.\\nMost equity-indexed annuities combine the guarantee features of a ˛xed \\nannuity with the potential for additional returns like that of a variable annuity. \\nEquity-indexed annuities may also be referred to as equity-indexed contracts \\nor EICs.\\n˜e following table compares the features of ˛xed and variable annuities:\\nFeature\\nFixed Annuity\\nVariable Annuity\\nPayment received\\nGuaranteed/˜xed\\nMay vary in amount\\nReturn\\nGuaranteed minimum\\nNo guarantee/return may \\nvary in amount\\nInvestment risk\\nAssumed by insurance co.Assumed by investor\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n119\\nFeature\\nFixed Annuity\\nVariable Annuity\\nPortfolio\\nReal estate, mortgages, and \\n˜xed income securities\\nStocks, bonds, or mutual \\nfund shares\\nPortfolio held in\\nGeneral account\\nSeparate account\\nIn˜ation\\nSubject to in˚ation riskResistant to in˚ation\\nRepresentative \\nregistration\\nInsurance license\\nInsurance and securities \\nlicense\\nRECOMMENDING VARIABLE ANNUITIES\\n˜ere are a number of factors that will determine if a variable annuity is a \\nsuitable recommendation for an investor. Variable annuities are meant to be \\nused as supplements to other retirement accounts such as IRAs and corporate \\nretirement plans. Variable annuities should not be recommended to inves\\n-\\ntors who are trying to save for a large purchase or expense such as college \\ntuition or a second home. Variable annuity products are more appropriate \\nfor an investor who is looking to create an income stream. A deferred annu\\n-\\nity contract would be appropriate for someone seeking retirement income \\nat some point in the future. An immediate annuity contract would be more \\nappropriate for someone seeking to generate current income and who is per\\n-\\nhaps already retired. Many annuity contracts have complex features and cost \\nstructures which may be diˆcult for both the representative and investor to \\nunderstand. ˜e bene˛ts of the contract should outweigh the additional costs \\nof the contract to ensure the contract is suitable for the investor. Illustrations \\nregarding performance of the contract may use a maximum growth rate of \\n12% and all annuity applications must be approved or denied by a principal \\nbased on suitability within 7 business days of receipt. A series 24 or series 26 \\nprincipal may approve or deny a variable annuity application presented by \\neither a series 6 or series 7 registered representative. 1035 exchanges allow \\ninvestors to move from one annuity contract to another without incurring \\ntax consequences. 1035 exchanges can be a red ˝ag and a cause for concern \\nover abusive sales practices. Because most annuity contracts have surrender \\ncharges that may be substantial, 1035 exchanges may result in the investor \\nbeing worse o˚ and may constitute churning. FINRA is concerned about \\n˛rms who employ compensation structures for representatives that may \\nincentivize the sale of annuities over other investment products with lower \\ncosts and which may be more appropriate for investors. Firms should guard \\nagainst incentivizing agents to sell annuity products over other investments. \\nMembers should ensure proper product training for investment advisers and \\nprincipals for annuities and they must have adequate supervision to monitor \\n \\n', '120\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nsales practices and to test their product knowledge. ˜e focus should be on \\ndetecting problematic and abusive sales practices. L share annuity contracts \\nare designed with shorter surrender periods, but have higher costs to inves-\\ntors. ˜e sale of L share annuity contracts can be a red ˝ag for compliance \\npersonnel and may constitute abusive sales practices.\\nANNUITY PURCHASE OPTIONS\\nAn investor may purchase an annuity contract in one of three ways. ˜ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nS\\ningle payment deferred annuity\\n2.\\n \\nS\\ningle payment immediate annuity\\n3.\\n \\nP\\neriodic payment deferred annuity\\nSINGLE PAYMENT DEFERRED ANNUITY\\nWith a single payment deferred annuity, the investor funds the contract com\\n-\\npletely with one payment and defers receiving payments from the contract \\nuntil some point in the future, usually a˙er retirement. Money being invested \\nin a single payment deferred annuity is used to purchase accumulation units. \\n˜e number and value of the accumulation units varies as the distributions \\nare reinvested and the value of the separate account™s portfolio changes.\\nSINGLE PAYMENT IMMEDIATE ANNUITY\\nWith a single payment immediate annuity, the investor funds the contract \\ncompletely with one payment and begins receiving payments from the con\\n-\\ntract immediately, normally within 60 days. ˜e money that is invested in \\na single payment immediate annuity is used to purchase annuity units. ˜e \\nnumber of annuity units remains ˛xed and the value changes as the value of \\nthe securities in the separate accounts portfolio ˝uctuates.\\nPERIODIC PAYMENT DEFERRED ANNUITY\\nWith a periodic payment annuity, the investor purchases the annuity by \\nmaking regularly scheduled payments into the contract. ˜is is known as the \\naccumulation stage. During the accumulation stage, the terms are ˝exible and, \\nif the investor misses a payment, there is no penalty. ˜e money invested in a \\nperiodic payment deferred annuity is used to purchase accumulation units. \\n˜e number and value of the accumulation units ˝uctuate with the securities \\nin the separate account™s portfolio.\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n121\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nThe suitability obligation for variable annuities covers the initial purchase \\nand subaccount allocation as well as the exchange of one annuity con\\n-\\ntact for any other contract. Exempt from suitability determination are \\nany changes made to the allocation of assets among the available sub \\naccounts.\\nACCUMULATION UNITS\\nAn accumulation unit represents the investor™s proportionate ownership in \\nthe separate account™s portfolio during the accumulation or di˚ered stage of \\nthe contract. ˜e value of the accumulation unit will ˝uctuate as the value \\nof the securities in the separate account™s portfolio changes. As the investor \\nmakes contributions to the account or as distributions are reinvested, the \\nnumber of accumulation units will vary. An investor will only own accumula\\n-\\ntion units during the accumulation stage when money is being paid into the \\ncontract or when receipt of payments is being deferred by the investor, such \\nas with a single payment deferred annuity.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nMost annuities allow the investor to designate a bene˚ciary who will receive \\nthe greater of the value of the account or the total premiums paid if the \\ninvestor dies during the accumulation stage.\\nANNUITY UNITS\\nWhen an investor changes from the pay-in or deferred stage of the contract \\nto the payout phase, the investor is said to have annuitized the contract. At \\nthis point, the investor trades in their accumulation units for annuity units. \\n˜e number of annuity units is ˛xed and represents the investor™s propor\\n-\\ntional ownership of the separate accounts portfolio during the payout phase. \\n˜e number of annuity units that the investor receives when they annuitize \\na contract is based upon the payout option selected, the annuitant™s age, sex, \\nthe value of the account, and the assumed interest rate.\\n', '122\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS\\nAnnuity contracts are not subject to the contribution limits or the required \\nminimum distributions of quali˛ed plans. An investor in an annuity has \\nthe choice of taking a lump sum distribution or receiving scheduled pay\\n-\\nments from the contract. If the investor decides to annuitize the contract and \\nreceive scheduled payments, once the payout option is selected, it may not be \\nchanged. ˜e following is a list of typical payout options in order from the \\nlargest monthly payment to the smallest. ˜ey are:\\n\\n \\nL\\nife only/straight life\\n\\n \\nL\\nife with period certain\\n\\n \\nJ\\noint with last survivor\\nLIFE ONLY/STRAIGHT LIFE\\n˜is payout option will give the annuitant the largest periodic payment from \\nthe contract and the investor will receive payments from the contract for their \\nentire life. However, when the investor dies, there are no additional bene˛ts \\npaid to their estate. If an investor has accumulated a large sum of money in \\nthe contract and dies unexpectedly shortly a˙er annuitizing the contract, the \\ninsurance company keeps the money in their account.\\nLIFE WITH PERIOD CERTAIN\\nA life with period certain payout option will pay out from the contract to the \\ninvestor or to their estate for the life of the annuitant or for the period certain, \\nwhichever is longer. If an investor selects a 10-year period certain when they \\nannuitize the contract and the investor lives for 20 years, payments will cease \\nupon the death of the annuitant. However, if the same investor died only two \\nyears a˙er annuitizing the contract, payments would go to their estate for \\nanother eight years.\\nJOINT WITH LAST SURVIVOR\\nWhen an investor selects a joint with last survivor option, the annuity is \\njointly owned by more than one party and payments will continue until \\nthe last owner of the contract dies. For example, if a husband and wife are \\nreceiving payments from an annuity under a joint with last survivor option \\nand the husband dies, payments will continue to the wife for the rest of her \\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n123\\nlife. ˜e payments received by the wife could be at the same rate as when \\nthe husband was alive or at a reduced rate, depending upon the contract. \\n˜e monthly payments will initially be based on the life expectancy of the \\nyoungest annuitant.\\nFACTORS AFFECTING THE SIZE OF \\nTHE ANNUITY PAYMENT\\nAll of the following determine the size of the annuity payments:\\n\\n \\nA\\nccount value\\n\\n \\nP\\nayout option selected\\n\\n \\nA\\nge\\n\\n \\nS\\nex\\n\\n \\nA\\nccount performance vs. the assumed interest rate (AIR)\\nTHE ASSUMED INTEREST RATE (AIR)\\nWhen an investor annuitizes a contract, they trade their accumulation units \\nin for annuity units. Once the contract has been annuitized, the insurance \\ncompany sets a benchmark for the separate account™s performance known \\nas the assumed interest rate or AIR. ˜e AIR is not a guaranteed rate of \\nreturn; it is only used to adjust the value of the annuity units up or down, \\nbased upon the actual performance of the separate account. ˜e assumed \\ninterest rate is an earnings target that the insurance company sets for the \\nseparate account. ˜e separate account must meet this earnings target \\nin order to keep the annuitant™s payments at the same level. As the value \\nof the annuity unit changes, so does the amount of the payment that is \\nreceived by the investor. If the separate account outperforms the AIR, an \\ninvestor would expect their payments to increase. If the separate account™s \\nperformance fell below the AIR, the investor could expect their payment to \\ndecrease. ˜e separate account™s performance is always measured against \\nthe AIR, never against the previous month™s performance. An investor™s \\nannuity payment is based on the number of annuity units owned by the \\ninvestor multiplied by the value of the annuity unit. When the performance \\nof the separate account equals the AIR, the value of the annuity unit will \\nremain unchanged and so will the investor™s payment. Selecting an AIR that \\n', '124\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nis realistic is important. If the AIR is too high and the separate account™s \\nreturn cannot equal the assumed rate, the value of the annuity unit will \\ncontinue to fall and so will the investor™s payment. ˜e opposite is true if \\nthe AIR is set too low. As the separate account outperforms the AIR, the \\nvalue of the annuity unit will continue to rise and so will the investor™s \\npayment. ˜e AIR is only relevant during the payout phase of the contract \\nwhen the investor is receiving payments and owns annuity units. ˜e AIR \\ndoes not concern itself with accumulation units during the accumulation \\nstage or when bene˛ts are being deferred.\\nTAXATION\\nContributions made to an annuity are made with a˙er-tax dollars. ˜e money \\nthe investor deposits becomes their cost base and is allowed to grow tax \\ndeferred. When the investor withdraws money from the contract, only the \\ngrowth is taxed. ˜eir cost base is returned to them tax free. All money in \\nexcess of the investor™s cost base is taxed as ordinary income.\\nTYPES OF WITHDRAWALS\\nAn investor may begin withdrawing money from an annuity contract through \\nany of the following options:\\n\\n \\nL\\nump sum\\n\\n \\nR\\nandom\\n\\n \\nAn\\nnuitizing\\nBoth lump sum and random withdrawals are done on a last in, ˛rst out \\n(LIFO) basis. ˜e growth portion of the contract is always considered to be \\nthe last money that was deposited and is taxed at the ordinary income rate \\nof the annuitant. If the annuitant is under age 59.5 and takes a lump sum or \\nrandom withdrawal, the withdrawal will be subject to a 10% tax penalty, as \\nwell as ordinary income taxes. An investor who needs to access the money in \\na variable annuity contract may be allowed to borrow from the contract. As \\nlong as interest is charged on the loan and the loan is repaid by the investor, \\nthe investor will not be subject to taxes.\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n125\\nANNUITIZING THE CONTRACT\\nWhen an investor annuitizes the contract and begins to receive monthly \\npayments, part of each payment is the return of the investor™s cost base and a \\nportion of each payment is the distribution of the account™s growth. To deter\\n-\\nmine how much of each payment is taxable and how much is the return of \\nprincipal, the investor would look at the exclusion ratio.\\nContracts that are annuitized prior to age 59.5 under a life-income option are \\nnot subject to the 10% tax penalty nor are withdrawals due to disability or death.\\nSALES CHARGES\\n˜ere is no maximum sales charge for an annuity contract. ˜e sales charge \\nthat is assessed must be reasonable in relation to the total payments over the \\nlife of the contract.

Investors may participate in retire\\n-\\nment plans that have been established by their employers, as well as those they \\nhave established for themselves. Both corporate and individual plans may be \\nquali˛ed or nonquali˛ed, and it is important for an investor to understand \\nthe di˚erence before deciding to participate. Series 65 candidates will see a \\nfair number of questions on the exam dealing with retirement plans. ˜e fol\\n-\\nlowing table compares the key features of quali˛ed and nonquali˛ed plans.\\nFeature\\nQuali˚edNonquali˚ed \\nContributions\\nPretax\\nAfter-tax\\nGrowth\\nTax-deferredTax-deferred\\nParticipation must be \\nallowed\\nFor everyone\\nCorporation may choose who \\ngets to participate\\nIRS approval\\nRequired\\nNot required\\nWithdrawals \\n100% taxed as \\nordinary income\\nGrowth in excess of cost base is \\ntaxed as ordinary income\\nINDIVIDUAL PLANS\\nIndividuals may set up a retirement plan for themselves that are quali˛ed and \\nallow contributions to the plan to be made with pretax dollars. Individuals \\nalso may purchase investment products such as annuities that allow their \\nmoney to grow tax deferred. ˜e money used to purchase an annuity has \\nalready been taxed, making an annuity a nonquali˛ed product.\\nINDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (IRAs)\\nAll individuals with earned income may establish an IRA for themselves. Con\\n-\\ntributions to traditional IRAs may or may not be tax deductible, depending \\non the individual™s level of adjusted gross income and whether the individual \\nis eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored plan. Individuals who do \\nnot qualify to participate in an employer-sponsored plan may deduct their \\nIRA contributions, regardless of their income level. ˜e level of adjusted \\ngross income that allows an investor to deduct their IRA contributions has \\nbeen increasing since 1998. ˜ese tax law changes occur too frequently to \\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n127\\nmake them a practical test question. Our review of IRAs will focus on the \\nfour main types, which are:\\n1.\\n \\nT\\nraditional\\n2.\\n \\nR\\noth\\n3.\\n \\nSE\\nP\\n4.\\n \\nE\\nducational\\nTRADITIONAL IRA\\nA traditional IRA allows an individual to contribute a maximum of 100% \\nof earned income or $5,500 per year or up to $11,000 per couple. If only \\none spouse works, the working spouse may contribute $5,500 to an IRA for \\nthemselves and $5,500 to a separate IRA for their spouse, under the nonwork\\n-\\ning spousal option. Investors over 50 may contribute up to $6,500 of earned \\nincome to their IRA. Regardless of whether the IRA contribution was made \\nwith pretax or a˙er-tax dollars, the money is allowed to grow tax deferred. \\nAll withdrawals from an IRA are taxed as ordinary income regardless of how \\nthe growth was generated in the account. Withdrawals from an IRA prior \\nto age 59.5 are subject to a 10% penalty tax as well as ordinary income taxes. \\n˜e 10% penalty will be waived for ˛rst-time homebuyers or educational \\nexpenses for the taxpayer™s child, grandchildren, or spouse. ˜e 10% penalty \\nwill also be waived if the payments are part of a series of substantially equal \\npayments. Withdrawals from an IRA must begin by April 1 of the year fol\\n-\\nlowing the year in which the taxpayer reaches 70.5. If an individual fails to \\nmake withdrawals that are suˆcient in size and frequency, the individual \\nwill be subject to a 50% penalty on the insuˆcient amount. An individual \\nwho makes a contribution to an IRA that exceeds 100% of earned income or \\n$5,500, whichever is less, will be subject to a penalty of 6% per year on the \\nexcess amount for as long as the excess contribution remains in the account.\\nROTH IRA\\nA Roth IRA is a nonquali˛ed account. All contributions made to a Roth IRA \\nare made with a˙er-tax dollars. ˜e same contribution limits apply for Roth \\nIRAs. An individual may contribute the lesser of 100% of earned income to a \\nmaximum of $5,500 per person or $11,000 per couple. Any contribution made \\nto a Roth IRA reduces the amount that may be deposited in a traditional IRA \\nand vice versa. All contributions deposited in a Roth IRA are allowed to grow \\ntax deferred and all of the growth may be taken out of the account tax free \\n', '128\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nprovided that the individual has reached age 59.5 and the assets have been \\nin the account for at least ˛ve years. A 10% penalty tax will be charged on \\nany withdrawal of earnings prior to age 59.5, unless the owner is purchasing \\na home, has become disabled, or has died. ˜ere are no requirements for an \\nindividual to take distributions from a Roth IRA by a certain age.\\n˜e following table details contribution limits that have been in place for \\nIRA contributions for the last several years:\\nYear\\nAge 49 & Below\\nAge 50 & Above\\n2012\\n$5,000\\n$6,000\\n2013\\n$5,500\\n$6,500\\n2014\\n$5,500\\n$6,500\\n2015\\n$5,500\\n$6,500\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nIndividuals and couples who are eligible to open a Roth IRA may convert \\ntheir traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. The investor will have to pay income \\ntaxes on the amount converted, but will not be subject to the 10% penalty.\\nSIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION (SEP) IRA\\nA SEP IRA is used by small corporations and self-employed individuals to \\nplan for retirement. A SEP IRA is attractive to small employers because it \\nallows them to set up a retirement plan for their employees rather quickly \\nand inexpensively. ˜e contribution limit for a SEP IRA far exceeds that of \\ntraditional IRAs. ˜e contribution limit is the lesser of 25% of the employee™s \\ncompensation or $52,000 per year. Should the employee wish to make their \\nannual IRA contribution to their SEP IRA, they may do so or they may make \\ntheir standard contribution to a traditional or Roth IRA.\\nPARTICIPATION\\nAll eligible employees must open an IRA to receive the employer™s contribu\\n-\\ntion to the SEP. If the employee does not open an IRA account, the employer \\nmust open one for them. ˜e employee must be at least 21 years old, have \\nworked during three of the last ˛ve years for the employer, and have earned \\nat least $550. All eligible employees must participate as well as the employer.\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n129\\nEMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS\\n˜e employer may contribute between 0% to 25% of the employee™s total \\ncompensation to a maximum of $52,000. Contributions to all SEP IRAs, \\nincluding the employer™s SEP IRA must be made at the same rate. An employee \\nwho is over 70.5 must also participate and receive a contribution. All eligible \\nemployees are immediately vested in the employer™s contributions to the plan.\\nSEP IRA TAXATION\\nEmployer™s contributions to a SEP IRA are immediately tax deductible by \\nthe employer. Contributions are not taxed at the employee™s rate until the \\nemployee withdraws the funds. Employees may begin to withdraw money \\nfrom the plan at age 59.5. All withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income and \\nwithdrawals prior to age 59.5 are subject to a 10% penalty tax.\\nIRA CONTRIBUTIONS\\nContributions to IRAs must be made by April 15 of the following calendar \\nyear, regardless of whether an extension has been ˛led by the taxpayer. Con\\n-\\ntributions may be made between January 1 and April 15 for the previous \\nyear, the current year, or both. All IRA contributions must be made in cash.\\nIRA ACCOUNTS\\nAll IRA accounts are held in the name of the custodian for the bene˛t of the \\naccount holder. Traditional custodians include banks, broker dealers, and \\nmutual fund companies.\\nIRA INVESTMENTS\\nIndividuals who establish IRAs have a wide variety of investments to choose \\nfrom when deciding how to invest the funds. Investors should always choose \\ninvestments that ˛t their investment objectives. ˜e following is a comparison \\nof allowable and nonallowable investments:\\nAllowable\\nNonallowable\\nStocks\\nMargin accounts\\nBonds\\nShort sales\\nMutual funds /ETFs/ETNs\\nTangibles/collectibles/art\\nAnnuities\\nSpeculative option trading\\n', '130\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nUITs\\nTerm life insurance\\nLimited partnerships\\nRare coins\\nU.S. minted coins\\nReal estate\\nWith rare exceptions an IRA may purchase real estate provided that very \\nstrict rules are followed regarding the property.\\nIT IS NOT WISE TO PUT A \\nMUNICIPAL BOND IN AN IRA\\nMunicipal bonds or municipal bond funds should never be placed in an \\nIRA, because the advantage of those investments is that the interest income \\nis free from federal taxes. Because their interest is free from federal taxes, \\nthe interest rate that is o˚ered will be less than the rates o˚ered by other \\nalternatives. ˜e advantage of an IRA is that money is allowed to grow tax \\ndeferred; therefore, an individual would be better o˚ with a higher yielding \\ntaxable bond of the same quality.\\nROLLOVER VS. TRANSFER\\nAn individual may want or need to move their IRA from one custodian to \\nanother. ˜ere are two ways by which this can be accomplished. An individual \\nmay rollover their IRA or they may transfer their IRA.\\nROLLOVER\\nWith an IRA rollover, the individual may take possession of the funds for \\na maximum of 60 calendar days prior to depositing the funds into another \\nquali˛ed account. An investor may only rollover their IRA once every \\n12 months. ˜e investor has 60 days from the date of the distribution to \\ndeposit 100% of the funds into another quali˛ed account or they must pay \\nordinary income taxes on the distribution and a 10% penalty tax, if the inves\\n-\\ntor is under 59.5.\\nTRANSFER\\nAn investor may transfer their IRA directly from one custodian to another \\nby simply signing an account transfer form. ˜e investor never takes posses\\n-\\nsion of the assets in the account and the investor may directly transfer their \\nIRA as o˙en as they like.\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n131\\nDEATH OF AN IRA OWNER\\nShould the owner of an IRA die, the account will become the property of \\nthe bene˛ciary named on the account by the owner. If the bene˛ciary is the \\nspouse of the owner special rules apply. ˜e spouse may elect to rollover the \\nIRA in to their own IRA or retirement plan such as a 401k. If this is elected \\nthere will be no tax presently due on the money. However, the spouse is still \\nsubject to the required minimum distribution rule at age 70½. ˜e surviving \\nspouse may also elect to cash in the IRA. ˜e distributions will be subject to \\nincome tax but will not be subject to the 10% penalty tax. If the bene˛ciary \\nis not the spouse the money may not be rolled in to another IRA or retire\\n-\\nment account. If the account owner died prior to age 70½ when the required \\ndistributions need to be made the money must all be distributed prior to the \\nend of the ˛˙h year or the money may be distributed in equal installments \\nbased upon the bene˛ciary™s life expectancy. If the account owner has died \\na˙er the start of the required minimum distributions the payment schedule \\nof distributions will now be based on the life expectancy of the bene˛ciary.\\nEDUCATIONAL IRA/COVERDELL IRA\\nAn educational IRA allows individuals to contribute up to $2,000 in a˙er-\\ntax dollars to an educational IRA for each student who is under the age of \\n18 years of age. ˜e money is allowed to grow tax deferred and the growth may \\nbe withdrawn tax free, as long as the money is used for educational purposes. \\nIf all of the funds have not been used for educational purposes by the time the \\nstudent reaches 30 years of age, the account must be rolled over to another \\n \\n \\nf\\namily member who is under 30 years of age or distributed to the original \\nstudent and is subject to a 10% penalty tax as well as ordinary income taxes.\\n529 PLANS\\nQuali˛ed tuition plans, more frequently referred to as 529 plans, may be set \\nup either as a prepaid tuition plan or as a college savings plan. With the pre\\n-\\npaid tuition plan, the plan locks in a current tuition rate at a speci˛c school.\\n˜e prepaid tuition plan can be set up as an installment plan or one \\nwhere the contributor funds the plan with a lump sum deposit. Many states \\nwill guarantee the plans but may require that either the contributor or the \\nbene˛ciary to be a state resident. ˜e plan covers only tuition and manda\\n-\\ntory fees. A room and board option is available for some plans. A college \\ncost-savings account may be opened by any adult and the donor does not \\n', '132\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nhave to be related to the child. ˜e assets in the college savings plan can be \\nused to cover all costs of quali˛ed higher education including tuition, room \\nand board, books, computers, and mandatory fees. ˜ese plans generally \\nhave no age limit by when assets must be used. College savings accounts \\nare not guaranteed by the state and the value of the account may decline in \\nvalue depending on the investment results of the account. Collage savings \\naccount are not state speci˛c and do not lock in a tuition rate. Contributions \\nto a 529 plan are made with a˙er-tax dollars and are allowed to grow tax \\ndeferred. ˜e assets in the account remain under the control of the donor, \\neven a˙er the student reaches the age of majority. ˜e funds may be used \\nto meet the student™s educational needs and the growth may be withdrawn \\nfederally tax-free. Most states also allow the assets to be withdrawn tax free. \\nAny funds used for nonquali˛ed education expenses will be subject to income \\ntax and a 10% penalty tax. If funds remain, or if the student does not attend \\nor complete quali˛ed higher education, then the funds may be rolled over to \\nanother family member within 60 days without incurring taxes and penalties. \\n˜ere are no income limits for the donors and contribution limits vary from \\nstate to state. 529 plans have an impact on a student™s ability to obtain need-\\nbased ˛nancial aid. However, because the 529 plans are treated as parental \\nassets and not as assets of the student, the plans are assessed at the expected \\nfamily contribution (EFC) rate of 5.64%. ˜is will have a signi˛cantly lower \\nimpact than plans and assets that are considered to be assets of the student. \\nStudent assets will be assessed at a 20% contribution rate.\\nKEOGH PLANS (HR-10)\\nA Keogh is a quali˛ed retirement plan set up by self-employed individuals, \\nsole proprietors, and unincorporated businesses. If the business is set up as \\na corporation, a Keogh may not be used.\\nKEOGH CONTRIBUTIONS\\nKeoghs may only be funded with earned income during a period when the \\nbusiness shows a gross pro˛t. If the business realizes a loss, no Keogh con\\n-\\ntributions are allowed. A self-employed person may contribute the lesser of \\n25% of their post-contribution income or $52,000. If the business has eligible \\nemployees, the employer must make a contribution for the \\n \\ne\\nmployees at the \\nsame rate as their own contribution. Employee \\n \\nc\\nontributions are based on \\nthe employee™s gross income and are limited to $52,000 per year.

Distributions from a TSA or TDA \\nprior to age 59.5 are subject to a 10% penalty tax, as well as ordinary income \\ntaxes. Distributions from a TSA/TDA must begin by age 70.5 or be subject \\nto an excess accumulation tax.\\nCORPORATE PLANS\\nA corporate retirement plan can be quali˛ed or nonquali˛ed. We will ˛rst \\nreview the nonquali˛ed plans.\\nNONQUALIFIED CORPORATE \\nRETIREMENT PLANS\\nNonquali˛ed corporate plans are funded with a˙er-tax dollars and the money \\nis allowed to grow tax deferred. If the corporation makes a contribution to \\nthe plan, they may not deduct the contribution from their corporate earnings \\nuntil the plan participant receives the money. Distributions from a nonquali\\n-\\n˛ed plan, which exceed the investors cost base, are taxed as ordinary income. \\nAll nonquali˛ed plans must be in writing and the employer may discriminate \\nas to who may participate.\\nPAYROLL DEDUCTIONS\\n˜e employee may set up a payroll deduction plan by having the employer \\nmake systematic deductions from the employee™s paycheck. ˜e money, which \\nhas been deducted from the employee™s check, may be invested in a variety \\nof ways. Mutual funds, annuities, and savings bonds are all usually available \\nfor the employee to choose from. Contributions to a payroll deduction plan \\nare made with a˙er-tax dollars.\\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS\\nA deferred compensation plan is a contract between an employee and an \\nemployer. Under the contract, the employee agrees to defer the receipt of \\nmoney owed to the employee from the employer until a˙er the employee \\nretires. A˙er retirement, the employee will traditionally be in a lower tax \\n', '136\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nbracket and will be able to keep a larger percentage of the money for them\\n-\\nselves. Deferred compensation plans are traditionally unfunded and, if the \\ncorporation goes out of business, the employee becomes a creditor of the \\ncorporation and may lose all of the money due under the contract. ˜e \\nemployee may only claim the assets if they retire, become disabled, or, in \\nthe case of death, their bene˛ciaries may claim the money owed. Money due \\nunder a deferred compensation plan is paid out of the corporation™s work\\n-\\ning funds when the employee or their estate claims the assets. Should the \\nemployee leave the corporation and go to work for a competing company, \\nthey may lose the money owed under a noncompete clause. Money owed to \\nthe employee under a deferred compensation agreement is traditionally not \\ninvested for the bene˛t of the employee and, as a result, does not increase in \\nvalue over time. ˜e only product that traditionally is placed in a deferred \\ncompensation plan is a term life policy. In the case of the employee™s death, \\nthe term life policy will pay the employee™s estate the money owed under \\nthe contract.\\nQUALIFIED PLANS\\nAll quali˛ed corporate plans must be in writing and set up as a trust. A trustee \\nor plan administrator will be appointed for the bene˛t of all plan holders.\\nTYPES OF PLANS\\n˜ere are two main types of quali˛ed corporate plans: a de˛ned bene˛t plan \\nand a de˛ned contribution plan.\\nDEFINED BENEFIT PLAN\\nA de˛ned bene˛t plan is designed to o˚er the participant a retirement bene˛t \\nthat is known or de˛ned. Most de˛ned bene˛t plans are set up to provide \\nemployees with a ˛xed percentage of their salary during their retirement, \\nsuch as 74% of their average earnings during their ˛ve highest paid years. \\nOther de˛ned bene˛t plans are structured to pay participants a ˛xed sum \\nof money for life. De˛ned bene˛t plans require the services of an actuary to \\ndetermine the employer™s contribution to the plan, based upon the partici\\n-\\npant™s life expectancy and bene˛ts promised.\\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n137\\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN\\nWith a de˛ned contribution plan, only the amount of money that is depos\\n-\\nited into the account is known, such as 6% of the employee™s salary. Both the \\nemployee and the employer may contribute a percentage of the employee™s \\nearnings into the plan. ˜e money is allowed to grow tax deferred until the \\nparticipant withdraws it at retirement. ˜e ultimate bene˛t under a de˛ned \\ncontribution plan is the result of the contributions into the plan, along with \\nthe investment results of the plan. ˜e employee™s maximum contribution \\nto a de˛ned contribution plan is $18,000 per year. Some types of de˛ned \\ncontribution plans are:\\n\\n \\n4\\n01K\\n\\n \\nMo\\nney purchase plan\\n\\n \\nP\\nro˛t sharing\\n\\n \\n˜r\\ni˙ plans\\n\\n \\nS\\ntock bonus plans\\nAll withdrawals from pension plans are taxed as ordinary income in the \\nyear in which the distribution is made.\\nPROFIT˙SHARING PLANS\\nPro˛t-sharing plans let the employer reward the employees by letting them \\nﬁshareﬂ in a percentage of the corporation™s pro˛ts. Pro˛t-sharing plans \\nare based on a preset formula and the money may be paid directly to the \\nemployee or placed in a retirement account. In order for a pro˛t-sharing plan \\nto be quali˛ed, the corporation must have substantial and recurring pro˛ts. \\n˜e maximum contribution to a pro˛t sharing plan is the lesser of 15% of \\nthe employee™s compensation or $52,000.\\n401K AND THRIFT PLANS\\n401K and thri˙ plans allow the employee to contribute a ˛xed percentage of \\ntheir salary to their retirement account and have the employer match some or \\nall of their contributions. A ﬁself-directed 401K planﬂ is one where the individual \\nor plan participant selects the investments to be made in the account from a \\nlist of investment choices. ˜e plan participant is the person who owns the \\naccount and is making contributions to the account to ﬁplanﬂ for their retire\\n-\\nment. ˜e employer, investment adviser, and plan administrator or trustee all \\nhave important roles in the creation and administration of a 401K plan.\\n', '138\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n˜e employer\\n is the entity that creates the plan for its employees and is \\nknown as the creator or plan sponsor.\\n˜e investment adviser\\n is the company who determines what investment \\nchoices will be o˚ered to the participants and who executes the orders entered \\nby the plan participants.\\n˜e plan administrator/trustee, \\nalso known as a third-party administra\\n-\\ntor, is the company that has physical custody of the plan™s assets and provides \\ncommunication to the participants regarding the plan.\\nROLLING OVER A PENSION PLAN\\nAn employee who leaves an employer may move their pension plan to another \\ncompany™s plan or to another quali˛ed account. ˜is may be accomplished by \\na direct transfer or by rolling over the plan. With a direct transfer, the assets \\nin the plan go directly to another plan administrator and the employee never \\nhas physical possession of the assets. When the employee rolls over their pen\\n-\\nsion plan, they take physical possession of the assets. ˜e plan administrator is \\nrequired to withhold 20% of the total amount to be distributed and the employee \\nhas 60 calendar days to deposit 100% of the assets into another quali˛ed plan. \\n˜e employee must ˛le with the federal government at tax time to receive a \\nreturn of the 20% of the assets that were withheld by the plan administrator.\\nEMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS\\nEmployers may establish stock option plans that allow employees to purchase \\nshares of the employer™s stock.

Not all decisions directly involving a plan, even when \\nmade by a ˛duciary, are subject to ERISA™s ˛duciary rules. ˜ese decisions are \\nbusiness judgment type decisions and are commonly called ﬁsettlorﬂ func\\n-\\ntions. ˜is caveat is sometimes referred to as the ﬁbusiness decisionﬂ exception \\nto ERISA™s ˛duciary rules. Under this concept, even though the employer is \\nthe plan sponsor and administrator, it will not be considered as acting in a \\n˛duciary capacity when creating, amending or terminating a plan. Among \\nthe decisions which would be considered settlor functions are:\\n\\n \\nC\\nhoosing the type of plan, or options in the plan;\\n\\n \\nA\\nmending a plan, including changing or eliminating plan options;\\n\\n \\nR\\nequiring employee contributions or changing the level of employee \\ncontributions;\\n\\n \\nT\\nerminating a plan, or part of a plan, including terminating or amending \\nas part of a bankruptcy process.\\nERISA also regulates all of the following:\\n\\n \\nP\\nension plan participation\\n\\n \\nF\\nunding\\n\\n \\nVe\\nsting\\n\\n \\nC\\nommunication\\n\\n \\nB\\nene˛ciaries\\nPLAN PARTICIPATION\\nAll plans governed by ERISA may not discriminate among who may partici\\n-\\npate in the plan.

A variable \\nlife policy is a ˛xed-premium plan that o˚ers the contract holder a minimum \\ndeath bene˛t. ˜e holder of a variable life insurance policy may choose how the \\ncash reserves are invested. A variable life policy typically o˚ers stocks, bonds, \\nmutual funds, and other portfolios as investment options. Although the \\nperformance of these investments may tend to outperform the performance \\nof more conservative alternatives, the cash value of the policy is not guaran\\n-\\nteed. ˜e cash and securities held by the insurance company are invested in \\nthe insurance company™s separate account and are kept segregated from the \\ninsurance company™s general account. ˜e separate account is required to \\nregister as either an open-end investment or as a UIT under ˜e Investment \\nCompany Act of 1940. Representatives who sell these policies must have both \\na securities license and an insurance license. ˜e insured is covered from the \\ndate of issuance to the date of death, as long as the premiums are paid.\\nOwners of variable life insurance policies must be allowed to exchange \\nthe policy for a whole life policy for 24 months. ˜e insurance company may \\nnot require new evidence of insurability as a condition of exchange. ˜e \\nage to determine the premium will be the age when the insured originally \\npurchased the variable life contract. Loans to policyholders must be made \\navailable a˙er 3 years based on the cash value of the contract. ˜e insurance \\ncompany must make at least 75% of the cash value available in the form of \\na loan. ˜e company is not required to make 100% of the cash value avail\\n-\\nable. Should the death bene˛t become payable during the time the loan is \\noutstanding the death bene˛t will be reduced by the amount of the loan. If \\nthe cash value of the contract falls into a negative balance while a loan is \\noutstanding the insurance company can require that enough of the loan be \\nrepaid to restore a positive cash value.\\nUNIVERSAL LIFE\\nA universal life insurance policy, unlike whole and variable life policies, has \\nno scheduled premium payments and a face amount that can be adjusted \\naccording to the policyholder™s needs. A universal life policy allows the poli\\n-\\ncyholder to decide when premiums are paid and to determine how large \\nthose payments will be. Should the insured determine that he or she needs \\nto change the amount of the insurance, the face amount of the policy may \\nbe adjusted up or down. ˜e policyholder has no scheduled premium pay\\n-\\nments, but the insured must make payments frequently enough to support \\n', 'CHAPTER 5\\n \\nV\\nariable Annuities and Retirement Plans\\n \\n143\\nthe policy. ˜e policy will stay in e˚ect as long as there is enough cash value \\nin the policy to support the payment of mortality and expense costs. ˜e net \\npremium payments are invested in the insurance company™s general account, \\nand a universal life policy is considered an insurance product. Representa\\n-\\ntives who sell universal life insurance policies must have their insurance \\nlicenses. Universal life insurance policies have two interest rates associated \\nwith them. A contract rate, which sets a minimum interest rate that will be \\npaid to the holder, and an annual rate that is set each year based on prevail\\n-\\ning interest rates.\\nVARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE/\\nUNIVERSAL VARIABLE LIFE\\nA variable universal life policy allows the policyholder the ability to deter\\n-\\nmine when premiums are paid and to decide how large those payments are. \\n˜e net premium is invested in the insurance company™s separate account, \\nand the policy™s cash value and variable death bene˛t are determined by the \\ninvestment experience of the separate account. A variable universal life insur\\n-\\nance policy will remain in e˚ect as long as there is enough cash value in the \\npolicy to support the cost of insurance. A variable universal life insurance \\npolicy may have a minimum guaranteed death bene˛t but does not have to. \\nRepresentatives who sell variable universal life polices must have both insur\\n-\\nance and securities licenses.\\nTAX IMPLICATIONS OF LIFE INSURANCE\\n˜ere are a number of tax implications that need to be understood by people \\nwho buy life insurance contracts. Generally, the premiums paid to the insurance \\ncompany for the life insurance policy are not tax deductible for federal income \\ntax purposes. However, should the death bene˛t become payable the amount \\npaid out to the bene˛ciary will be received tax free. Of critical importance \\nwhen determining the tax implications of life insurance is recognizing who the \\nﬁownerﬂ of the policy is. If the insured person is deemed to be the owner of the \\ncontract then the amount of the death bene˛t payable on the contract will be \\nincluded in the value of the person™s estate for estate tax purposes. ˜e owner of \\nthe policy is the person who has the right to name a bene˛ciary, borrow from \\nthe policy, transfer ownership, and determine how dividends or cash value are \\ninvested. To ensure that the policy is not considered to be an asset of the estate \\nwhen determining estate taxes o˙entimes people will establish the policy so \\nthat the policy is owned by their spouse or by an irrevocable life insurance trust \\n(ILT). By establishing the ownership of the life insurance policy in an ILT the \\ndeath bene˛t will not impact the value of the insured™s estate.\\n', '', '145\\n \\nCHAPTER\\n \\n5\\nPretest\\nVARIABLE ANNUITIES AND RETIREMENT PLANS\\n1.\\n \\nA d\\noctor makes the maximum contribution to his Keogh plan while \\nearning $300,000 per year.

As ˜xed assets wear out, their value declines. \\nCompanies may reduce the value of their assets through depreciation and \\nmay use the amount of the depreciation to o˛set taxes owed. Depreciation \\nis a noncash charge that lowers a company™s tax liability. Depending on the \\ntype of asset involved, depreciation may be taken as either straight line depre\\n-\\nciation or as accelerated depreciation. Straight line deprecation is taken in \\nequal amounts over the estimated useful life of the asset. A piece of heavy \\nequipment costing $10,000,000 with a useful life of 10 years would be depreci\\n-\\nated at $1,000,000 per year for 10 years. Accelerated depreciation depreciates \\nmost of the value of the asset in the ˜rst few years of useful life and by lesser \\namounts during the remaining years. Depreciation impacts both the income \\nstatement and balance sheet of a corporation. A company™s taxable income is \\nreduced by the amount of the depreciation taken in the current period and \\naccumulated depreciation reduces the value of the asset on the company™s \\nbalance sheet.\\nIssuing Securities: \\nIf the company were to issue additional shares of \\n \\n$1 par common stock, the net worth of the company would increase by the \\namount of the par value sold, plus any paid in surplus. As a result of the issu\\n-\\nance of the securities, the corporation™s cash position would also be increased \\nby the net proceeds of the o˛ering.\\nDeclaring a Dividend: \\nWhen a cash dividend is declared, the corporation™s \\nretained earnings are reduced by the amount of the dividend and the company™s \\ncurrent liabilities are increased by the amount of the dividend payable. Once \\nthe dividend is paid, the company™s cash and current assets are reduced by the \\namount of the dividend paid. ˚e payment of the dividend also eliminates the \\ncurrent liability that resulted from the declaration of the dividend.\\nConversion of Convertible Securities: \\nIf the holder of a convertible bond \\nconverts the bonds into common stock, the par value of the bonds will be \\neliminated as a long-term liability and the par value will be credited to the \\nequity account on the balance sheet.\\nBond Redemption: \\nBonds are redeemed at maturity.

Ana\\n-\\nlysts must be able to determine how susceptible the company™s earnings are \\nto a change in the economy. ˚ere are three industry categories. ˚ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nG\\nrowth industries\\n2.\\n \\nC\\nyclical industries\\n3.\\n \\nD\\nefensive industries\\nGrowth Industries: \\n˚e earnings of companies in a growth industry \\nwill grow faster than the overall growth of the economy as whole. Growth \\nindustries include computers and technology.\\nCyclical Industries: \\n˚e earnings of a company in a cyclical industry are \\nhighly susceptible to the condition of the overall economy. As the economy \\nimproves, the company will do well. If the economy does poorly, the company \\nwill perform poorly. Cyclical industries include manufacturing, raw materi\\n-\\nals, and automobiles.\\nDefensive Industries: \\n˚e earnings of a company in a defensive industry will \\nbe the least susceptible to the changes in the overall economy. Defensive industries \\ninclude food and pharmaceuticals. ˚ese are things that people will buy no matter \\nhow the economy is performing. It is important to note that a manufacturer of \\nmilitary equipment is not considered to be in a defensive industry.\\nTOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP ANALYSIS\\nRather than simply zeroing in on the ˜nancial picture of a given company \\nmany analysts will include an evaluation of the industry or sector and the \\neconomy as a whole to further validate their research. An analyst who employs \\na top-down approach would look at how the economy as a whole is performing \\n', 'CHAPTER 6\\n \\nF\\nundamental and Technical Analysis\\n \\n159\\nand identify industries that will perform the best in the current and pre\\n-\\ndicted economic climate. Once the industry is identi˜ed the analyst will try \\nto identify the best performing company within that industry as a potential \\ncandidate for investment. Conversely, an analyst who employs a bottom-up \\napproach would start their research with the company and expand it to the \\nindustry or sector and then ˜nally to the economy as a whole to evaluate an \\ninvestment opportunity.\\nDIVIDEND VALUATION MODELS\\nA fundamental analyst may use a dividend valuation model to determine a \\nfair valuation for an equity security and to determine if an investment is war\\n-\\nranted. ˚e two dividend valuation models most o˝en used are the dividend \\ndiscount model and the dividend growth model.\\n˚e Dividend Discount Model:\\n ˚e dividend discount model takes the \\nsum of all future dividends to be received and discounts them into a net pres\\n-\\nent value. ˚e model states that the market price of the stock should be equal \\nto the net present value of all future cash ˆows. A simple way to estimate the \\nvalue based on this method would be to take the annual dividend and divide \\nit by the prevailing rate paid by other similar investments. If a utility stock is \\npaying a $2 annual dividend and other similar utilities are yielding 5% the \\nmarket price can be estimated to be $40. Found as follows:\\n$2 / .05 \\n˜\\n $40\\n˚e dividend discount model may be used for issues that have both ˜xed and \\nvariable dividends over time.\\n˚e Dividend Growth Model:\\n ˚e dividend growth model values the \\nstock based on the net present value of the cash ˆow to be generated by a \\ndividend that is expected to grow over time. It is unlikely that you will have \\nto calculate the value of a stock based on the dividend growth model. It is \\nimportant to know that the present value is signi˜cantly higher for an equity \\nwith a dividend that is predicted to grow. ˚e higher the growth rate the \\nhigher the net present value. Because the dividend growth model calculates \\na higher net present value this model will predict a higher stock price than a \\ndividend valuation model based on a constant dividend.\\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\\nA technical analyst uses the patterns created by the past price performance \\nof the stock to predict the direction of the stock price in the future. A \\n', '160\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\ntechnical analyst is not concerned with the fundamentals of the company \\nor even what business the company is in. ˚ey are only interpreting chart \\npatterns and other technical factors relating to the price performance of \\nthe stock.

A chartist would draw a line \\nconnecting the series of higher lows to con˜rm the trend and the trend line \\nshould provide some support to the stock price.\\nDownward Trend Lines: \\nA downward trend line is characterized by a \\nseries of lower highs and a series of lower lows. A chartist would draw a line \\nconnecting the series of lower highs to con˜rm the downward trend and the \\ntrend line should provide some resistance to the stock price.\\nReversals: \\nA reversal indicates a signi˜cant change in the price action of \\nthe stock. A bullish reversal indicates the end of a downward trend and the \\nbeginning of a new upward trend. A bearish reversal indicates the end of an \\nupward trend and the beginning of a new downward trend. One of the most \\nsigni˜cant reversal patterns is the head-and-shoulders formation. A head-and-\\nshoulders top is a bearish reversal of an uptrend, while a head-and-shoulders \\nbottom is a bullish reversal of a downtrend.\\nConsolidation: \\nA consolidation pattern is characterized by a horizontal \\nmovement in the stock price. Buyers and sellers are attracted to the market \\nand are willing to trade the stock at almost the same prices.\\n', 'CHAPTER 6\\n \\nF\\nundamental and Technical Analysis\\n \\n161\\n˚e following illustrate the chart patterns just outlined:\\n', '162\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n', 'CHAPTER 6\\n \\nF\\nundamental and Technical Analysis\\n \\n163\\nMARKET THEORIES AND INDICATORS\\nA technical analyst will look at various indicators to interpret the overall \\nmarket™s direction. ˚ese indicators include:\\n\\n \\nS\\nhort interest\\n\\n \\nO\\ndd lot trading\\n\\n \\nA\\ndvance decline line\\nShort Interest: \\nInvestors who have sold stock short are betting that the \\nstock price falls. In order to close out their position, they must repurchase \\nthe stock. All investors who have sold stock short must eventually repurchase \\nthe stock. Because all of the short sellers are potential buyers for the stock, a \\nhigh short interest is considered a bullish indicator.\\nOdd Lot Trading: \\n˚e odd lot trading theory believes that smaller inves\\n-\\ntors, who cannot a˛ord to buy or sell one round lot of stock, will invariably \\nbuy and sell at the wrong time. A high level of odd lot purchases is indicative \\nof a market top. A high level of odd lot sales is indicative of a market bottom.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nBoth the short interest theory and the odd lot trading theory are contrar\\n-\\nian indicators.\\n', '164\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nAdvance Decline Line: \\n˚e advance decline line indicates the breadth of \\nthe market. ˚e market™s breadth is a good indicator of the overall health of \\nthe market and can be used to con˜rm or reject a trend. ˚e advance decline \\nline will tell an investor how many stocks are trading higher in price and how \\nmany are trading lower in price.\\nA technical analyst will always look for volume con˜rmation of any trend. \\nA trend is con˜rmed by high levels of volume in the stock or in the market \\nas a whole.\\nEFFICIENT MARKET THEORY\\n˚e e˙cient market theory believes that all of the available information is \\npriced into the market at any given time and it is impossible to beat the market \\nby taking advantage of price or time ine˙ciencies. Proponents of the e˙cient \\nmarket theory may follow the theory in the following ways:\\nWeak-form e˛ciency\\n states that the future price of a security cannot be \\npredicted by studying the past price performance of the security. ˚is form \\nof the theory believes that technical analysis cannot produce excess returns \\nas all of the past prices and volume information relating to the security are \\nwidely known.\\nSemi-strong form e˛ciency\\n states that the market price of a security \\nadjusts too rapidly to newly available information to achieve an excess return \\nby trading on that information. ˚e information contained in the past price \\nperformance as well as information released in company quarterly, annual, \\nand other reports is widely known and is reˆected in the price of the security.\\nStrong-form e˛ciency\\n states that the current price of a security reˆects \\nall information known and unknown to the public and there is no opportu\\n-\\nnity to earn excess returns. Investors who subscribe to the strong form of the \\ne˙cient market theory believe that even someone in possession of non-public \\nmaterial information will not be able to earn excess returns by trading on \\nthat information.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nThe random walk theory similarly states the prices of securities adjust too \\nrapidly to all available information and that throwing a dart at a listing of \\nstocks would produce the same returns as detailed analysis. \\n', 'CHAPTER 6\\n \\nF\\nundamental and Technical Analysis\\n \\n165\\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\\nSome analysts will employ statistical analysis or the study of mathematical \\ndata in security evaluation models. Analysts will plot the price points at which \\na security has traded under a standardized bell curve to determine the poten\\n-\\ntial pricing outcomes for a security. ˚e wider the distribution of the price \\npoints the wider the range. ˚e range is the di˛erence between the lowest \\nprice and highest price at which a security has traded over a given period. ˚e \\nwider the range the higher the standard deviation and therefore the higher the \\nrisk associated with the security and its potential return. Analysts will review \\nthe price points plotted underneath the bell curve distribution to determine \\nvarious measures of central tendency. ˚ere are several measures that can \\nbe used to determine the midpoint of the range all distributions, these are \\nthe arithmetic mean, median, and mode.\\nArithmetic Mean:\\n ˚e arithmetic mean is found by adding all of the \\nprice observations together and dividing the total by the number of price \\nobservations. ˚e arithmetic mean can be thought of as the average price at \\nwhich the security traded over the observation period.\\nMedian:\\n The median is the exact middle of all price observations and \\nis the price point on the bell curve that separates the higher prices from \\nthe lower prices. The median is found by listing all of the prices numeri\\n-\\ncally from lowest to highest and picking the price in the exact middle. \\nIf there is an even number of price observations there will be no single \\nmedian value therefore the median value will be the average of the two \\nmiddle values.\\nMode:\\n ˚e mode is the price observation that appears most frequently on \\nthe price distribution curve. Simply put, the mode is the price at which the \\nsecurity has most frequently traded. While the mode will have a signi˜cant \\nimpact on the mean and median as a result of the frequency of its occur\\n-\\nrences, it tends to be a price that is not like the price calculated by the mean \\nand the median.\\nStatistical analysis may be applied to individual equities or to the returns \\ngenerated by portfolios containing a number of securities. When comparing \\nportfolios, any portfolio with the highest mean relative to the median and \\nmode contains investments that have signi˜cantly outperformed the other \\ninvestments. Statistical analysis in ˜nance is part of the broad school of \\nquantitative analysis. Simply put, quantitative analysis is based on the study \\nof quantities (the number of occurrences and observations).

Market indexes are divided into two main types: capitalization-\\n \\nweighted and price-weighted indexes. ˚e two types are characterized as follows:\\nCapitalization-Weighted Index:\\n A market benchmark whose value is \\nderived from the price action of the companies whose shares are included in \\nthe index. More weight is given to the price performance of the shares of the \\ncompanies with the greatest market capitalization. Market capitalization is the \\ntotal value of all the outstanding shares. ˚e NASDAQ Composite, NASDAQ \\n100, NYSE Composite, Russell 2000, S & P 500, S & P 100, and Wilshire 5000 \\nare all the capitalization-weighted indexes. ˚e Wilshire 5000 provides the \\nbroadest coverage of all the indexes.\\nPrice-Weighted Index:\\n A market benchmark whose value is derived from the \\nprice action of the companies whose shares are included in the index. More weight \\nis given to the price performance of the shares of the companies with higher stock \\nprices. A change in the price of a $100 stock would have a greater impact on the \\nvalue of the index than a change in the share price of a $10 stock. ˚e Dow Jones \\nIndustrial, Transportation, and Utility averages are all price-weighted indexes.\\nInternational Indexes.\\n Like the indexes created here in the United States, \\nforeign markets also have created indexes to track the performance of their \\nmarkets. ˚e Nikkei in Japan, the FTSE in England, and the DAX in Germany \\nall track the markets in their respective countries.

Alternatively, if the provider of those goods or \\nservices tries to ˜ood the market with those goods or services, the price \\nwill tend to decline as the supply outpaces the demand. The supply and \\ndemand model works for all goods and services including stocks, bonds, \\nreal estate, and money. Series 65 candidates will see a fair number of \\nquestions on economics.\\nGROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT\\nA country™s gross domestic product (GDP) measures the overall health of a \\nnation™s economy. ˜e GDP is de˚ned as the value of all goods and services \\nproduced in a country including consumption, investments, government \\nspending, and exports minus imports during a given year.\\nEconomists chart the health of the economy by measuring the country™s \\nGDP and by monitoring supply and demand models, along with the nation™s \\nbusiness cycle. A country™s economy is always in ˛ux. Periods of increasing \\noutput are always followed by periods of falling output. ˜e business cycle \\nhas four distinct stages:\\n1.\\n \\nE\\nxpansion\\n2.\\n \\nPe\\nak\\n', '170\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n3.\\n \\nC\\nontraction\\n4.\\n \\nTr\\nough\\nEXPANSION\\nDuring an expansionary phase, an economy will see an increase in overall \\nbusiness activity and output. Corporate sales, manufacturing output, wages, \\nand savings will all increase while the economy is expanding or growing. \\nAn economy cannot continue to grow inde˚nitely and GDP will top out at \\nthe peak of the business cycle. An economic expansion is characterized by:\\n\\n \\nI\\nncreasing GDP\\n\\n \\nR\\nising consumer demand\\n\\n \\nR\\nising stock market\\n\\n \\nR\\nising production\\n\\n \\nR\\nising real estate prices\\nPEAK\\nAs the economy tops out, the GDP reaches its maximum output for this cycle \\nas wages, manufacturing, and savings all peak.\\nCONTRACTION\\nDuring a contraction, GDP falls, along with productivity, wages, and \\nsavings. Unemployment begins to rise, the stock market begins to fall, and \\ncorporate pro˚ts decline as inventories rise.\\nTROUGH\\n˜e economy bottoms out in the trough as GDP hits its lowest level for the \\ncycle. As GDP bottoms out, unemployment reaches its highest level, wages \\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nE\\nconomic Fundamentals\\n \\n171\\nbottom out, and savings bottom out. ˜e economy is now poised to enter a \\nnew expansionary phase and start the cycle all over again.\\nRECESSION\\nA recession is defined as a period of declining GDP, which lasts at least \\nsix months or two quarters. Recessions may vary in degree of severity \\nand in duration. Extended recessions may last up to 18 months and may \\nbe accompanied by steep downturns in economic output. In the most \\nsevere recessions falling prices erode businesses™ pricing power, margins, \\nand profits as deflation takes hold. Recessions are generally triggered by \\nan overall decrease in spending by businesses and consumers. As busi\\n-\\nnesses and consumers pull back spending, overall demand falls. Businesses \\nand consumers will often reduce spending as a cautionary measure in \\nresponse to an economic event or shock, such as a financial crisis, or the \\nbusting of a bubble in an inflated asset class, such as real estate or the \\nstock market. \\nDEPRESSION\\nA depression is characterized by a decline in GDP, which lasts at least \\n18 months or six consecutive quarters. GDP o˝en falls by 10% or more dur\\n-\\ning a depression. A depression is the most severe type of recession and is \\naccompanied by extremely high levels of unemployment and frozen credit \\nmarkets. ˜e steep fall in demand is more likely to lead to de˛ation during \\na depression. \\nECONOMIC INDICATORS\\n˜ere are various economic activities that one can look at to try to identify \\nwhere the economy is in the business cycle. An individual can also use these \\neconomic indicators as a way to try and predict the direction of the economy \\nin the future. ˜e three types of economic indicators are:\\n1.\\n \\nL\\neading indicators\\n2.\\n \\nC\\noincident indicators\\n3.\\n \\nL\\nagging indicators\\n', '172\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nLEADING INDICATORS\\nLeading indicators are business conditions that change prior to a change in \\nthe overall economy. ˜ese indicators can be used as a gauge for the future \\ndirection of the economy.

Economics has been referred to as the dismal science as it is largely \\nfocused on the study of shortages. Economists all generally believe that low \\nin˛ation and low unemployment are signs of a healthy economy. However, \\nthe di˙erent schools of economic thought believe that economic prosperity \\ncan be restored or maintained through very di˙erent approaches. \\nCLASSICAL ECONOMICS \\n˜e classical economic theory also known as supply side economics believes \\nthat lower taxes, and less government regulation will stimulate growth and \\nincrease demand through higher employment. Less regulation of business \\ncreates lower barriers to entry for employers and allows employers to produce \\ngoods at lower prices and to create more jobs. As a result of the lower prices, \\nlower taxes, and higher employment, aggregate demand in the economy will \\nincrease, positively impacting the nation™s gross domestic product. \\nKEYNESIAN ECONOMICS \\nJohn Maynard Keynes ˚rst published his theories on economics in 1936 during \\nthe Great Depression. ˜e Keynesian economic model believes that a mixed \\neconomy based on private and public sector e˙orts will produce desired eco\\n-\\nnomic conditions. Keynesians believe that the decisions made in the private \\nsector can lead to supply and demand imbalances and that an active policy \\nresponse from the public sector in the form of government spending (˚scal \\npolicy) and adjustments to the money supply (monetary policy) is required. \\nTHE MONETARISTS\\nEconomists who subscribe to monetary economics believe that the supply \\nof money in the economy can in˛uence the direction of the economy and \\nprices as a whole. During times of low demand and high unemployment the \\neconomy can be stimulated by increasing the money supply. As more money \\n', '174\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nenters the system interest rates fall increasing demand. As more money enters \\nthe system the value of the currency tends to decline and during times of \\nexpansionary monetary policy in˛ation may increase. Milton Friedman the \\nfounder of the monetarist movement believed that the main focus of central \\nbanks should be on price stability.\\nECONOMIC POLICY\\n˜e government has two tools that it can use to try to in˛uence the direction \\nof the economy. Monetary policy, which is controlled by the Federal Reserve \\nBoard, determines the nation™s money supply, while ˚scal policy is controlled \\nby the president and Congress and determines government spending and \\ntaxation.\\nTOOLS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\\n˜e Federal Reserve Board will try to steer the economy through the busi\\n-\\nness cycle by adjusting the level of money supply and interest rates. ˜e \\nFed may:\\n\\n \\nC\\nhange the reserve requirement for member banks\\n\\n \\nC\\nhange the discount rate charged to member banks\\n\\n \\nS\\net target rates for federal fund loans\\n\\n \\nB\\nuy and sell U.S. government securities through open-market operations\\n\\n \\nC\\nhange the amount of money in circulation\\n\\n \\nU\\nse moral suasion\\nINTEREST RATES\\nInterest rates, put simply, are the cost of money. Overall interest rates are \\ndetermined by the supply and demand for money, along with any upward \\nprice movement in the cost of goods and services, known as in˛ation. ˜ere \\nare several key interest rates upon which all other rates depend:\\n\\n \\nD\\niscount rate\\n\\n \\nF\\nederal funds rate\\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nE\\nconomic Fundamentals\\n \\n175\\n\\n \\nBr\\noker call loan rate\\n\\n \\nPr\\nime rate\\nTHE DISCOUNT RATE\\n˜e discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve Bank charges \\non loans to member banks. A bank may borrow money directly from the \\nFederal Reserve by going to the discount window, and the bank will be \\ncharged the discount rate. ˜e bank is then free to lend out this money at \\na higher rate and earn a pro˚t, or it may use these funds to meet a reserve \\nrequirement shortfall. Although a bank may borrow money directly from \\nthe Federal Reserve, this is discouraged, and the discount rate has become \\nlargely symbolic.\\nFEDERAL FUNDS RATE\\n˜e federal funds rate is the rate that member banks charge each other for \\novernight loans. ˜e federal funds rate is widely watched as an indicator for \\nthe direction of short-term interest rates.\\nBROKER CALL LOAN RATE\\n˜e broker call loan rate is the interest rate that banks charge on loans \\nto broker dealers to ˚nance their customers™ margin purchases. Many \\nbroker dealers will extend credit to their customers to purchase securi\\n-\\nties on margin. ˜e broker dealers will obtain the money to lend to their \\ncustomers from the bank, and the loan is callable or payable on demand \\nby the broker dealer.\\nPRIME RATE\\n˜e prime rate is the rate that banks charge their largest and most credit\\n-\\nw\\northy corporate customers on loans. ˜e prime rate has lost a lot of its \\nsigni˚cance in recent years because mortgage lenders are now basing their \\nrates on other rates, such as the 10-year Treasury note. ˜e prime rate is, \\nhowever, very important for consumer spending, because most credit card \\ninterest rates are based on prime plus a margin.\\n', '176\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nRESERVE REQUIREMENT\\nMember banks must keep a percentage of their depositors™ assets in an \\naccount with the Federal Reserve. ˜is is known as the reserve requirement. \\n˜e reserve requirement is intended to ensure that all banks maintain a \\ncertain level of liquidity. Banks are in business to earn a pro˚t by lending \\nmoney. As the bank accepts accounts from depositors, it pays them interest \\non their money. ˜e bank, in turn, takes the depositors™ money and loans \\nit out at higher rates, earning the di˙erence. If the Fed wanted to stimulate \\nthe \\n \\nec\\nonomy, it might reduce the reserve requirement for the banks, which \\nwould allow the banks to lend more. By making more money available to \\nborrowers, interest rates will fall and, therefore, demand will increase, help\\n-\\ning to stimulate the economy. If the Fed wanted to slow down the economy, \\nit might increase the reserve requirement. ˜e increased requirement would \\nmake less money available to borrowers. Interest rates would rise as a result \\nand the demand for goods and services would slow down. Changing the \\nreserve requirement is the least-used Fed tool.\\nCHANGING THE DISCOUNT RATE\\n˜e Federal Reserve Board may change the discount rate in an e˙ort to \\nguide the economy through the business cycle. Remember, the discount \\nrate is the rate that the Fed charges member banks on loans. ˜is rate is \\nhighly symbolic, but as the Fed changes the discount rate, all other interest \\nrates change with it. If the Fed wanted to stimulate the economy, it would \\nreduce the discount rate. As the discount rate falls, all other interest rates \\nfall with it, making the cost of money lower. ˜e lower interest rate should \\nencourage borrowing and demand to help stimulate the economy. If the Fed \\nwanted to slow the economy down, it would increase the discount rate. As \\nthe discount rate increases, all other rates go up with it, raising the cost of \\nborrowing. As the cost of borrowing increases, demand and the economy \\nslow down.\\nFEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE\\n˜e Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the Fed™s most ˛exible tool. \\n˜e FOMC through open-market operations will buy and sell U.S. govern\\n-\\nment securities in the secondary market in order to control the money sup\\n-\\nply. If the Fed wants to stimulate the economy and reduce rates, it will buy \\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nE\\nconomic Fundamentals\\n \\n177\\ngovernment securities. When the Fed buys the securities, money is instantly \\nsent into the banking system. As the money ˛ows into the banks, more \\nmoney is available to lend. Because there is more money available, interest \\nrates will go down and borrowing and demand should increase to stimulate \\nthe economy. If the Fed wants to slow the economy down it will sell U.S. \\ngovernment securities. When the Fed sells the securities, money ˛ows from \\nthe banks and into the Fed, thus reducing the money supply. Because there \\nis less money available to be loaned out, interest rates will increase, slowing \\nborrowing and demand. ˜is will have a cooling e˙ect on the economy. ˜e \\nFOMC also issues statements that can ﬁjawboneﬂ investors to take certain \\nactions and sets a benchmark for what it believes the fed funds rate should be. \\nHowever, the marketplace is the ultimate factor in setting the fed funds rate.\\nMONEY SUPPLY\\nPrior to determining an appropriate economic policy, economists must have \\nan idea of the amount of money that is in circulation, along with the amount \\nof other types of assets that will provide access to cash. Economists gauge the \\nmoney supply using three measures. ˜ey are:\\n\\n \\nM1\\n\\n \\nM2\\n\\n \\nM3\\nM1\\nM1 is the largest and most liquid measure of the nation™s money supply and \\nit includes:\\n\\n \\nC\\nash\\n\\n \\nD\\nemand deposits (Checking accounts)\\nM2\\nIncludes all the measures in M1 plus:\\n\\n \\nM\\noney market instruments\\n\\n \\nT\\nime deposits of less than $100,000\\n\\n \\nN\\negotiable CDs exceeding $100,000\\n\\n \\nO\\nvernight repurchase agreements\\n', '178\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nM3\\nIncludes all of the measures in M1 and M2 plus\\n\\n \\nT\\nime deposits greater than $100,000\\n\\n \\nR\\nepurchase agreements with maturities greater than 1 day\\nDISINTERMEDIATION\\nDisintermediation occurs when people take their money out of low yielding \\naccounts o˙ered by ˚nancial intermediaries or banks and invest money in \\nhigher yielding investments.\\nMORAL SUASION\\n˜e Federal Reserve Board o˝en will use moral suasion as a way to in˛u\\n-\\nence the economy. ˜e Fed is very powerful and very closely watched. By \\nsimply implying or expressing their views on the economy, they can slightly \\nin˛uence the economy.\\nMonetarists believe that a well-managed money supply, with an increas\\n-\\ning bias, will produce price stability and will promote the overall economic \\nhealth of the economy. Milton Friedman is believed to be the founder of the \\nmonetarist movement.\\nFISCAL POLICY\\nFiscal policy is controlled by the president and Congress and determines \\nhow they manage the budget and government expenditures to help steer the \\neconomy through the business cycle. Fiscal policy may change the levels of:\\n\\n \\nF\\nederal spending\\n\\n \\nF\\nederal taxation\\n\\n \\nC\\nreation or use of federal budget de˚cits or surpluses\\nFiscal policy assumes that the government can in˛uence the economy \\nby adjusting its level of spending and taxation. If the government wanted to \\nstimulate the economy, it may increase spending. ˜e assumption here is that \\nas the government spends more, it will increase aggregate demand and, there\\n-\\nfore, productivity. Additionally, if the government wanted to stimulate the \\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nE\\nconomic Fundamentals\\n \\n179\\neconomy, it may reduce the level of taxation. As the government reduces taxes, \\nit leaves a larger portion of earnings for the consumers and businesses to spend. \\n˜is should also have a positive impact on aggregate demand. Alternatively, \\nif the government wanted to slow down the economy, it may reduce spend\\n-\\ning to lower the level of aggregate demand or raise taxes to reduce demand \\nby taking money out of the hands of the consumers. John Maynard Keynes \\nbelieved that it was the duty of the government to be involved with control\\n-\\nling the direction of the economy and the nation™s overall economic health.\\nAs both the Federal Reserve Board and the government monitor the overall \\nhealth of the U.S. economy, they look at various indicators some of which are:\\n\\n \\nC\\nonsumer price index\\n\\n \\nI\\nn˛ation/de˛ation\\n\\n \\nR\\neal GDP\\nCONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI) \\nThe consumer price index is made up of a basket of goods and services \\nthat consumers most often use in their daily lives. The consumer price \\nindex is used to measure the rate of change in overall prices. A CPI that \\nis rising would indicate that prices are going up and that inflation is \\npresent. A falling CPI would indicate that prices are falling and defla\\n-\\ntion is present.\\nINFLATION/DEFLATION\\nIn˛ation is the persistent increase in prices, while de˛ation is the persistent \\ndecrease in prices. Both economic conditions can harm a county™s economy. \\nIn˛ation will eat away at the purchasing power of the dollar and results \\nin higher prices for goods and services. De˛ation will erode corporate \\npro˚ts as weak demand in the marketplace drives prices for goods and \\nservices lower.\\nREAL GDP\\nReal GDP is adjusted for the effects of inflation or deflation over time. \\nGDP is measured in constant dollars so that the gain or loss of the dollar™s \\npurchasing power will not show as a change in the overall productivity \\nof the economy.\\n', '180\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nBoth monetary policy and ˚scal policy have a major e˙ect on the stock \\nmarket as a whole.\\n˜e following are bullish for the stock market:\\n\\n \\nF\\nalling interest rates\\n\\n \\nI\\nncreasing money supply\\n\\n \\nI\\nncrease in government spending\\n\\n \\nFa\\nlling taxes\\n˜e following are bearish for the stock market:\\n\\n \\nI\\nncreasing taxes\\n\\n \\nI\\nncreasing interest rates\\n\\n \\nF\\nalling government spending\\n\\n \\nF\\nalling money supply\\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY CONSIDERATIONS\\nThe world has become a global marketplace. Each country™s economy is \\naffected to some degree by the economies of other countries. Currency \\nvalues relative to other currencies will impact a country™s international \\ntrade and the balance of payments. The amount of another country™s cur\\n-\\nrency that may be received for a country™s domestic currency is known \\nas the exchange rate. The balance of payments measures the net inflow \\n(surplus) or outflow (deficit) of money. The largest component of the bal\\n-\\nance of payments is the balance of trade. As the exchange rates fluctuate, \\none country™s goods may become more expensive, while another county™s \\ngoods become less expensive. A weak currency benefits exporters, while \\na strong currency benefits importers.\\nLONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE / LIBOR\\nLIBOR is the most widely used measure of short-term interest rates around \\nthe world. The LIBOR rate is the market-driven interest rate charged by \\nand between financial institutions, similar to the fed funds rate in the \\nUnited States. LIBOR loans range from 1 day to 1 year and the rate is \\ncalculated by the British Banker™s Association in a variety of currencies \\nincluding euros, U.S. dollars, and yes.\\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nE\\nconomic Fundamentals\\n \\n181\\nYIELD CURVE ANALYSIS \\nEconomists and investors may analyze both the cost of borrowed funds given \\nvarious maturities and the general health of the economy by looking at the \\nshape of the yield curve. With a normal, ascending, positive, or upward slop\\n-\\ning yield curve, the level of interest rates increases as the term of the maturity \\nincreases. Simply put, lenders are going to demand higher interest rates on \\nlonger-term loans. ˜e longer the lenders have to wait to be repaid and the \\nlonger their money is at risk, the higher the level of compensation (interest) \\nrequired to make the loan. Higher interest rates also compensate the lend\\n-\\ners for the time value of money. ˜e dollars received in 10, 20, or 30 years \\nwill be worth less than the value of the dollars loaned to borrowers today. \\nAn upward slopping curve is present during times of economic prosperity \\nand depicts the expectation of increased interest rates in the future. ˜e \\nyield curve will also graphically demonstrate investor™s expectations about \\nin˛ation. ˜e higher the expectations are for in˛ation, the higher the level \\nof corresponding interest rates for the period of high in˛ation. Occasionally \\nthe yield curve may become inverted, negative, or downward sloping during \\ntimes when demand for short-term funds are running much higher than the \\ndemand for longer-term loans or in times where the Federal Reserve Board \\nhas increased short-term rates to combat an economy that is growing too \\nquickly and threatening long-term price stability. With an inverted yield \\ncurve, interest rates on short-term loans far exceed the interest rates on \\nlonger-term loans. An inverted yield curve tends to normalize quickly and \\nis o˝en a precursor to a recession. ˜e yield curve may also ˛atten out when \\nthe interest rates for both short-term and long-term loans are approximately \\nequal to one another.\\n1yr\\nInterest\\nY\\nield Ra\\nte\\ns\\nNormal \\nYi\\neld Cur\\nve\\n  \\n5yr\\n10yr\\n20yr\\n30yr\\nT\\nime\\n', '182\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n1yr\\nInterest\\nY\\nield Ra\\nte\\ns\\nIn\\nve\\nrt\\ned Yield Cur\\nve\\n  \\n5yr\\n10yr\\n20yr\\n30yr\\n(30 \\nye\\nar\\ns™\\n time)\\nT\\nime\\n', '183\\n \\nCHAPTER\\n \\n7\\nPretest\\nECONOMIC \\nFUNDAMENTALS\\n1.\\n \\nD\\nuring an in˛ationary period, the price of which one of the following \\nwill fall the most?\\na.\\n \\nPr\\neferred stock \\nb.\\n \\nT\\nreasury bills \\nc.\\n \\nT\\nreasury bonds\\nd.\\n \\nC\\nommon stock\\n2.\\n \\nA\\nll of the following are bullish for the stock market, except: \\na.\\n \\nFa\\nlling taxes\\nb.\\n \\nI\\nncreasing government spending\\nc.\\n \\nI\\nncreasing money supply\\nd.\\n \\nI\\nncreasing interest rates\\n3.\\n \\nE\\nconomic theories believe all of the following to be true, except: \\na.\\n \\nA\\ns supply rises, prices tend to fall.\\nb.\\n \\nA\\ns supply rises, prices tend to rise.\\nc.\\n \\nA m\\noderately increasing money supply promotes price stability.\\nd.\\n \\nA\\ns demand rises, prices tend to rise.\\n', '184\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n4.\\n \\nW\\nhich one of the following interest rates is controlled by the Federal \\nReserve Board? \\na.\\n \\nPr\\nime rate\\nb.\\n \\nF\\nederal funds rate\\nc.\\n \\nBr\\noker call loan rate\\nd.\\n \\nD\\niscount rate\\n5.\\n \\nA\\nll of the following indicate a downturn in the business cycle, except: \\na.\\n \\nR\\nising inventories\\nb.\\n \\nH\\nigh consumer debt \\nc.\\n \\nF\\nalling inventories \\nd.\\n \\nF\\nalling stock prices\\n6.\\n \\nA b\\nank with a shortfall meeting their reserve requirement could borrow \\nmoney from another bank and pay the:\\na.\\n \\nF\\nederal funds rate \\nb.\\n \\nBr\\noker call loan rate\\nc.\\n \\nPr\\nime rate\\nd.\\n \\nD\\niscount rate\\n7.\\n \\n˜\\ne government has two tools it can use to try to in˛uence the direction \\nof the economy; they are:\\na.\\n \\nM\\nonetary policy and ˚scal policy\\nb.\\n \\nPr\\nime rate policy and ˚scal policy\\nc.\\n \\nM\\nonetary policy and prime rate policy\\nd.\\n \\nF\\niscal policy and money market policy\\n8.\\n \\nF\\niscal policy is controlled by: \\nI.\\n \\nP\\nresident\\nII.\\n \\nF\\nOMC\\nIII.\\n \\nC\\nongress\\nIV.\\n \\nFR\\nB\\na.\\n \\nI a\\nnd IV \\nb.\\n \\nI a\\nnd II \\nc.\\n \\nI\\nI and IV\\nd.\\n \\nI a\\nnd III\\n', 'CHAPTER 7\\n \\nP\\nretest\\n \\n185\\n9.\\n \\n˜\\ne Federal Reserve Board sets all of the following except: \\na.\\n \\nM\\nonetary policy\\nb.\\n \\nR\\neserve requirement\\nc.\\n \\nG\\novernmental spending\\nd.\\n \\nD\\niscount rate\\n10.\\n \\nA d\\necline in the GDP must last at least how long to be considered a \\nrecession? \\na.\\n \\nTw\\no quarters\\nb.\\n \\nO\\nne quarter\\nc.\\n \\nS\\nix quarters \\nd.\\n \\nF\\nour quarters\\n', '', ' \\nCHAPTER\\n \\n8\\nRecommendations, Professional \\nConduct, and Taxation\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAll recommendations to customers must be suitable based upon \\nthe customer™s investment objectives, their ˜nancial pro˜le, and their \\nattitudes toward investing.

Investment advisers have a ˚duciary duty to provide only suitable \\nadvice to clients. Violations of state and federal laws may result in ˚nes, \\nexpulsion from the state or industry, or a jail term. Investment advisers are \\nexpected to adhere to all of the rules and regulations set forth in the Invest\\n-\\nment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as all state and federal laws.\\nTHE UNIFORM PRUDENT INVESTORS ACT OF 1994\\n˜e Uniform Prudent Investors Act of 1994 (UPIA) sets the basic standards by \\nwhich all investment professionals acting in a ˚duciary capacity must abide. \\n˜e UPIA updates the requirements and de˚nitions of prudent standards in \\nlight of the application of modern portfolio theory and the advancement in \\nthe understanding of the behavior of capital markets. ˜e UPIA laid out ˚ve \\nfundamental changes in the approach to prudent investing for investment \\nprofessionals acting in a ˚duciary capacity. ˜ose changes are:\\n1.\\n \\n˜\\ne main consideration of a ˚duciary is the management and trade o˛ \\nbetween risk and reward.\\n2.\\n \\n˜\\ne standard of prudence for each investment will be viewed in relation\\n-\\nship to the overall portfolio rather than as a stand alone investment.\\n3.\\n \\n˜\\ne rules regarding diversi˚cation have become part of the de˚nition of \\nprudent investing.\\n4.\\n \\n˜\\ne restrictions from investing in various types of investments have been \\nremoved and the trustee may invest in anything that is appropriate in \\nlight of the objectives of the trust and in line with other requirements of \\nprudent investing.\\nWhile making a recommendation, an adviser may not:\\n\\n \\nGu\\narantee or promise a pro˜t or promise no loss\\n\\n \\nM\\nake false, misleading, or fraudulent statements\\n\\n \\nM\\nake unfair comparisons to dissimilar products\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n189\\n5.\\n \\n˜\\ne rules against delegating the duties of the trustee have been removed and \\nthe trustee may now delegate investment functions subject to safeguards.\\nFAIR DEALINGS WITH CLIENTS\\nAll investment advisers are required to act in good faith in all of their dealings \\nwith customers and are required to uphold just and equitable trade practices. \\nAn investment adviser may not employ or engage in:\\n\\n \\nC\\nhurning\\n\\n \\nM\\nanipulative and deceptive practices\\n\\n \\nU\\nnauthorized trading\\n\\n \\nFr\\naudulent acts\\n\\n \\nB\\nlanket recommendations\\n\\n \\nM\\nisrepresentations\\n\\n \\nOm\\nitting material facts\\n\\n \\nM\\naking guarantees\\n\\n \\nS\\nelling dividends\\n\\n \\nR\\necommending speculative securities without knowing the customer \\ncan a˛ord the risk\\n\\n \\nS\\nhort-term trading in mutual funds\\n\\n \\nS\\nwitching fund families\\n\\n \\nC\\nharging fees in excess of fees disclosed in the advisory contract\\nCHURNING\\nMany advisers are compensated when the customer makes a transaction based \\non their recommendation. Churning is a practice of making transactions that \\nare excessive in size or frequency with the intention to generate higher com\\n-\\nmissions for the adviser. When determining if an account has been churned, \\nregulators will look at the frequency of the transactions, size of the transac\\n-\\ntions, and the amount of commission earned by the representative. Customer \\npro˚tability is not an issue when determining if an account has been churned.\\nIn addition to churning where the agent or ˚rm executes too many trans\\n-\\nactions to increase revenue, a practice known as reverse churning is also a \\nviolation. Reverse churning is the practice of placing inactive accounts or \\naccounts that do not trade frequently into fee-based programs that charge \\n \\n', '190\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nan annual fee based on the assets in the account. ˜is fee covers all advice \\nand execution charges. Since these inactive accounts do not trade frequently \\nit will cause the total fees charged to the account to increase and makes a \\nfee-based account unsuitable for inactive accounts and for accounts that \\nsimply buy and hold securities for a long period of time. ˜ese accounts will \\ngenerally be charged an annual fee in the range of 1Œ2% of the total value of \\nthe assets in lieu of commissions when orders are executed.\\nMANIPULATIVE AND DECEPTIVE DEVISES\\nIt is a violation for an adviser to engage in or employ any arti˚ce or scheme that \\nis designed to gain an unfair advantage over another party. Some examples \\nof manipulative or deceptive devises are:\\n\\n \\nC\\napping\\n\\n \\nPe\\ngging\\n\\n \\nF\\nront running\\n\\n \\nT\\nrading ahead\\n\\n \\nP\\nainting the tape/matched purchases/matches sales\\nCapping:\\n A manipulative act designed to keep a stock price from rising \\nor to keep the price down.\\nPegging: \\nA manipulative act designed to keep a stock price up or to keep \\nthe price from falling.\\nFront Running: \\n˜e entering of an order for the account of an agent or \\n˚rm, prior to the entering of a large customer™s order. ˜e ˚rm or agent is using \\nthe customer™s order to pro˚t on the order they entered for their own account.\\nTrading Ahead: \\n˜e entering of an order for a security, based on the prior \\nknowledge of a soon-to-be-released research report.\\nPainting the Tape:\\n A manipulative act by two or more parties designed \\nto create false activity in the security without any bene˚cial change in owner\\n-\\nship. ˜e increased activity is used to attract new buyers.\\nCUSTOMER COMPLAINTS\\nAll written complaints received from a customer or from an individual acting \\non behalf of the customer must be reported promptly to the principal of the \\n˚rm. ˜e ˚rm must maintain a separate customer complaint folder, even if it \\nhas not received any written customer complaints. If the ˚rm™s ˚le contains \\ncomplaints, the ˚le must state what action was taken by the ˚rm, if any, and it \\nmust disclose the location of the ˚le containing any correspondence relating \\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n191\\nto the complaint. When a written complaint is received by mail or email, the \\ncustomer who has issued the complaint must be noti˚ed that the complaint \\nhas been received. If a customer ˚les a complaint and subsequently withdraws \\nthe complaint, the ˚rm is still requested to maintain the correspondence \\nrelating to the complaint in the ˚rm™s complaint ˚le.\\nUNAUTHORIZED TRADING\\nAn unauthorized transaction is one that is made for the bene˚t of a customer™s \\naccount at a time when the customer has no knowledge of the trade and the \\nadviser does not have discretionary power over the account.\\nFRAUDULENT ACTS\\nFraud is de˚ned as any act that is employed to obtain an unfair advantage \\nover another party. Fraudulent acts include:\\n\\n \\nF\\nalse statements\\n\\n \\nD\\neliberate omissions of material facts\\n\\n \\nC\\noncealment of material facts\\n\\n \\nM\\nanipulative and deceptive practices\\n\\n \\nFor\\ngery\\n\\n \\nM\\naterial omission\\n\\n \\nLy\\ning\\nBLANKET RECOMMENDATIONS\\nIt is inappropriate for an adviser to make blanket recommendations in any \\nsecurity, especially low-priced speculative securities. No matter what type of \\ninvestment is involved, a blanket recommendation to a large group of people \\nwill always be wrong for some investors. Di˛erent investors have di˛erent \\nobjectives and the same recommendation will not be suitable for everyone.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nMr. Jones, an agent with XYZ brokers, has a large customer base that ranges \\nfrom young investors who are just starting to save to institutions and retirees. \\nMr. Jones has been doing a signi˚cant amount of research on WSIA industries, \\na mining and materials company. Mr. Jones strongly believes that WSIA is \\nsigni˚cantly undervalued based on its assets and earning potential. Mr. Jones \\nrecommends WSIA to all his clients. In the next six months, the share price \\nof WSIA increases signi˚cantly as new production dramatically increases \\n', '192\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nsales just as Mr. Jones™ research suggested. ˜e clients then sell WSIA at Mr. \\nJones™ suggestion and realize a signi˚cant pro˚t.\\nANALYSIS \\nEven though the clients who purchased WSIA based on Mr. Jones™ recom\\n-\\nmendation made a signi˚cant pro˚t, Mr. Jones has still committed a violation \\nbecause he recommended it to all of his clients. Mr. Jones™ clients have a wide \\nvariety of investment objectives and the risk or income potential associated \\nwith an investment in WSIA would not be suitable for every client. Even if \\nan investment is pro˚table for the client, it does not mean it was suitable for \\nthe client. Blanket recommendations are never suitable.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nAn investment adviser who has discretion over client accounts may in certain \\ncircumstances be found to have made unsuitable blanket recommendations \\nif the adviser purchases a signi˜cant amount of an illiquid security for a \\nlarge number of client accounts. This action could also be deemed to be \\nmarket manipulation.\\nSELLING DIVIDENDS\\nSelling dividends is a violation that occurs when an adviser uses a pending \\ndividend payment as the sole basis of their recommendation to purchase the \\nstock or mutual fund. Additionally, using the pending dividend as a means \\nto create urgency on the part of the investor to purchase the stock is a prime \\nexample of this type of violation. If the investor was to purchase the shares \\njust prior to the ex-dividend date simply to receive the dividend, the investor, \\nin many cases, will end up worse o˛. ˜e dividend in this case will actually be \\na return of the money that the investor used to purchase the stock and then \\nthe investor will have a tax liability when they receive the dividend.\\nMISREPRESENTATIONS\\nAn adviser may not knowingly make any misrepresentations regarding:\\n\\n \\nC\\nlient™s account status\\n\\n \\nR\\nepresentative\\n\\n \\nF\\nirm\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n193\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment\\n\\n \\nF\\nees to be charged\\nOMITTING MATERIAL FACTS\\nA representative may not omit any material fact either good or bad when \\nrecommending a security. A material fact is one that an investor would need \\nto know in order to make a well-informed investment decision. ˜e adviser \\nmay, however, omit an immaterial fact.\\nGUARANTEES\\nNo representative, broker dealer, or investment adviser may make any guar\\n-\\nantees of any kind. A pro˚t may not be guaranteed and a promise of no loss \\nmay not be made.\\nRECOMMENDING MUTUAL FUNDS\\nAn adviser recommending a mutual fund should ensure that the mutual \\nfund™s investment objective meets the customer™s investment objective.

Investors who take on risk \\nthrough the purchase of an investment must be compensated for that risk \\nthrough a higher expected rate of return known as the risk premium. A \\nsecurity™s risk is measured by its beta. ˜erefore, securities with higher \\nbetas must o˛er investors a higher expected return in order for the inves\\n-\\ntor to be compensated for taking on the additional risk associated with \\nthat investment. Proponents of CAPM have developed the capital market \\nline or CML to evaluate and measure the expected returns of a diversi˚ed \\nportfolio relative to the expected returns of the market and the expected \\nrisk-free return. ˜e CML also measures the standard deviation of the \\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n203\\nportfolio relative to the standard deviation of the market. A further deriva\\n-\\ntive measure known as the security market line or SML is used to measure \\nthe expected return of a single security based on its beta relative to the \\nexpectations of the market and risk-free rate of return. ˜e CML is not \\nbased on alpha or beta, while the SML is partially computed based on the \\nbeta of the single security in question.\\nRISK VS. REWARD\\nRisk is the reciprocal of reward. An investor must be o˛ered a higher rate of \\nreturn for each unit of additional risk the investor is willing to assume. ˜ere \\nare many types of risk involved with investing money. ˜ey are as follows:\\n\\n \\nCa\\npital risk\\n\\n \\nMa\\nrket risk\\n\\n \\nN\\nonsystematic risk\\n\\n \\nL\\negislative risk\\n\\n \\nTi\\nming risk\\n\\n \\nC\\nredit risk\\n\\n \\nRei\\nnvestment risk\\n\\n \\nC\\nall risk\\n\\n \\nL\\niquidity risk\\nCAPITAL RISK\\nCapital risk is the risk that an investor may lose all or part of the capital they \\nhave invested. Investors who purchase securities are not assured of the return \\nof their invested principal.\\nMARKET RISK\\nMarket risk is also known as a systematic risk and it is the risk that is inher\\n-\\nent in any investment in the markets. For example, you could own stock in \\nthe greatest company in the world and you could still lose money because \\nthe value of your stock is going down, simply because the market as a whole \\nis going down.\\n', '204\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nNONSYSTEMATIC RISK\\nNonsystematic risk is the risk that pertains to one company or industry. For \\nexample, the problems that the tobacco industry faced a few years ago would \\nnot have a˛ected a computer company.\\nLEGISLATIVE RISK\\nLegislative risk is the risk that the government will do something that adversely \\na˛ects your investment. For example, beer manufacturers probably did not \\nfare too well when the government enacted Prohibition.\\nTIMING RISK\\nTiming risk is simply the risk that an investor will buy and sell at the wrong \\ntime and will lose money as a result.\\nCREDIT RISK\\nCredit risk is the risk of default inherent in debt securities. An investor may \\nlose all or part of their money because the issuer has defaulted and cannot \\npay the interest or principal payments owed to the investor.\\nREINVESTMENT RISK\\nWhen interest rates decline and higher yielding bonds have been called \\nor have matured, investors will not be able receive the same return given \\nthe same amount of risk. This is reinvestment risk and the investor is \\nforced to either accept the lower rate or must take more risk to obtain \\nthe same rate.\\nINTEREST RATE RISK\\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the price of bonds will fall as interest rates \\nincrease. As interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds fall and may subject \\nthe bondholder to a loss if they need to sell the bond.\\nCALL RISK\\nCall risk is the risk that, as interest rates decline, higher yielding bonds and \\npreferred stocks will be called and investors will be forced to reinvest the \\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n205\\nproceeds at a lower rate of return or at a higher rate of risk to achieve the same \\nreturn. Call risk only applies to preferred stocks and bonds with a call feature.\\nOPPORTUNITY RISK\\nInvestors who hold long-term bonds until maturity must forgo the opportu\\n-\\nnities to invest that money in other potentially higher yielding investments.\\nLIQUIDITY RISK\\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an investor will not be able to liquidate \\ntheir \\n \\ni\\nnvestment when they need to or that they will not be able to liqui-\\n \\ndate their investment without adversely a˛ecting the price.\\nALPHA\\nA stock™s or portfolio™s alpha is its projected independent rate of return or \\nthe di˛erence between an investment™s expected (benchmark) return and its \\nactual return. Portfolio managers whose portfolios have positive alphas are \\nadding value through their asset selection. ˜e outperformance as measured \\nby alpha indicates the portfolio manager is adding additional return for each \\nunit of risk taken on in the portfolio.\\nBETA\\nA stock™s beta is its projected rate of change relative to the market as a whole. If \\nthe market was up 10% for the year, a stock with a beta of 1.5 could reasonably \\nbe expected to be up 15%. A stock with a beta greater than one has a higher \\nlevel of volatility than the market as a whole and is considered to be more risky \\nthan the overall market. A stock with a beta of less than one is less volatile than \\nprices in the overall market and is considered to be less risky. An example of \\na low beta stock would be a utility stock. ˜e price of utility stocks does not \\ntend to move dramatically. A security™s beta measures its nondiversi˚able or \\nsystematic risk. For each incremental unit of risk an investor takes on, they \\nmust be compensated with additional expected returns. If the portfolio™s actual \\nreturn exceeds that of its expected return, the portfolio has generated excess \\nreturns. ˜e Sharpe ratio can measure a portfolio™s risk-adjusted return. If two \\nportfolios both return 8%, but Portfolio A contains dramatically more risk than \\n', '206\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nPortfolio B, then Portfolio B is a much better investment choice. ˜e Sharpe \\nratio will tell an investor how well they are being compensated for the invest\\n-\\nment risk they are assuming. ˜e Sharpe ratio takes the portfolio™s return and \\nsubtracts the risk-free return o˛ered on short-term Treasury bills (usually 90 \\ndays) to determine the level of return that the investor earned over the risk-free \\nreturn. ˜e risk premium then is divided by the portfolio™s standard deviation. \\n˜e Sharpe ratio appears as follows:\\nSharpe ratio \\n˜\\n (R \\n˚\\n RFR)/SD\\nSeries 65 candidates will have to be able to identify the Sharpe ratio, but \\nmost likely will not be required to calculate it. ˜e degree to which a portfolio™s \\nperformance is designed to mirror the return of a standard benchmark or \\nindex is measured by R-squared. If the portfolio has 100% of its assets tied to \\nthe index such as in an index fund, the portfolio will have an R-squared read\\n-\\ning of 100 and the performance of the portfolio will mirror the performance \\nof the index. ˜e higher the R-squared reading for the portfolio, the higher \\nthe degree of correlation to the index. R-squared values range from 0 to 100 \\nwith the lower values having lower correlation to the index. A portfolio with \\na higher R-squared value will have a more accurate beta coeˆcient and as a \\nresult the volatility of the portfolio will be more predictable.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nBeta measures systematic risk in the price volatility of a security relative \\nto the market as whole. Standard deviation measures both systematic \\nand unsystematic risk in the volatility of the return of a security versus its \\nexpected return.\\nEXPECTED RETURN\\nModern portfolio managers try to manage risk and evaluate investments \\nby employing a variety of concepts under modern portfolio theory. Modern \\nportfolio theory states that the expected rate of return for an investment is \\nthe sum of its weighted returns. An investment™s weighted return is its pos\\n-\\nsible return multiplied by the likelihood of that return being realized. ˜e \\nfollowing table details the expected return for XYZ:\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n207\\nOpinion\\nExpected \\nReturn\\nProbability \\nof\\n \\nExpected \\nReturn\\nWeighted \\n \\nReturn\\nOutperform\\n20%\\n25%\\n5%\\nMarket perform\\n10%\\n50%\\n5%\\nUnderperform\\n \\n5%\\n25%\\n1.25%\\nExpected return\\n11.25%\\n˜e following table details the expected return for ABC:\\nOpinion\\nExpected \\n \\nReturn\\nProbability \\nof\\n \\nExpected \\nReturn\\nWeighted \\n \\nReturn\\nOutperform\\n40%\\n10%\\n4%\\nMarket perform\\n20%\\n70%\\n14%\\nUnderperform\\n(33.75%)\\n20%\\n(6.75%)\\nExpected return\\n11.25%\\nNotice that the expected rate of return for both XYZ and ABC is 11.25%. \\nHowever, an investment in XYZ contains less risk than an investment in ABC \\nbecause the distribution of potential returns is not as wide as the distribu\\n-\\ntion of potential returns for ABC. An investor who is considering investing \\nin either XYZ or ABC would consider the 11.25% expected return o˛ered by \\nXYZ to be more attractive than the same expected return o˛ered by ABC. \\n˜e distribution of an investment™s varying expected returns is measured by \\nthe investment™s standard deviation. ˜e wider the distribution of an invest\\n-\\nment™s expected returns, the greater its standard deviation. Investments with \\nhigher standard deviations contain more risk than investments with lower \\nstandard deviations. As an investment™s results are plotted over time, there \\nis a 95% chance that its actual return will be within two standard deviations \\nof its expected return and a 67% chance that it will be within one standard \\ndeviation of its expected return. Portfolio managers will use computer simu\\n-\\nlations to examine the possibilities of various portfolio strategies. ˜e Monte \\nCarlo simulation is one such simulation used by portfolio managers.\\nTIME VALUE OF MONEY\\nAs time progresses, in˝ation eats away at the value or the purchasing power of \\nthe dollar. ˜at is to say that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomor\\n-\\nrow. Investors can determine the future value of a sum invested if they know \\nthe interest rate, the time horizon, and the compounding schedule. ˜e future \\nvalue of a sum invested today can be determined by using the following formula:\\n', '208\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nFV \\n˜\\n PV (1 \\n˛\\n R)\\nT\\nFV \\n˜\\n Future value\\nPV \\n˜\\n Present value\\nR \\n˜\\n Interest rate\\nT \\n˜\\n Number of compounding periods for which the money will be \\ninvested\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nFV \\n˜\\n ?\\nPV \\n˜\\n $1,000\\nR \\n˜\\n 5%\\nT \\n˜\\n 5 years compounded annually\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,000 (1 \\n˛\\n .05)\\n5\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,000 (1.276)\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,276\\n˜e future value of the investment will increase as the number of com\\n-\\npounding periods increases. Let™s look at what would happen to the same \\ninvestment of $1,000 for ˚ve years at 5% if the interest was compounded \\nsemiannually. Everything would remain the same except T would be 10 and \\nthe interest rate for each semiannual period would be half the annual rate. \\nIn this example, we get:\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,000 (1 \\n˛\\n .025)\\n10\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,000 (1.28)\\nFV \\n˜\\n $1,280\\nMore compounding periods increase the investor™s total return.\\nAn investor can also determine the present value of a future payment by \\nusing the following formula:\\nPV \\n˜\\n FV/(1 \\n˛\\n R)\\nT\\nAn investor can also use the present value formula to determine how much \\nthey would have to invest today to have a given sum of money in the future. For \\nexample, let™s say that an investor wants to have $10,000 saved for their child™s \\ncollege tuition ˚ve years from now. If the investor knows that they can receive \\n6% on their money, they can determine how much they must invest today. ˜e \\npresent value of $10,000 ˚ve years from now at a 6% rate is found as follows:\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n209\\nPV \\n˜˝\\n$10,000\\n(1 \\n˛\\n .06)\\n5\\nPV \\n˜˝\\n$10,000\\n1.338\\nPV \\n˜\\n $7,473\\n˜e investor would have to invest $7,473 today at a 6% rate to have $10,000 \\n˚ve years from now. Investors can also use the present value and future value \\nto determine an investment™s internal rate of return through a process called \\niteration. ˜e internal rate of return or IRR takes into consideration the time \\nvalue of money and all of the future cash ˝ows generated by an investment. ˜e \\nIRR is the annualized e˛ective compound rate of return. When evaluating an \\ninvestment in a debt security the IRR is equal to the bond™s yield to maturity. \\nAn investor would not use an IRR calculation to evaluate an investment in \\nan equity security because dividends may be stopped or reduced and equity \\nsecurities have no maturity date. ˜e IRR is the discount rate that results in \\nthe future value and the present value being equal. ˜e higher the IRR the \\nmore attractive the investment. Portfolio managers and business operators \\ncan use the IRR calculation to measure an investment™s or project™s IRR \\nagainst their desired rate of return to determine if the investment meets their \\nrequirements. Series 65 candidates will not have to calculate an investment™s \\ninternal rate of return.\\nWEIGHTED RETURNS\\nAn investor who is evaluating the performance of a portfolio manager must \\ntake into consideration the impact that any contributions or withdrawals \\nmade by the investor will have on the overall performance of the account. \\nIn evaluating the performance of a manager who is overseeing an account \\nwhere the investor will be making contributions and withdrawals, the investor \\nshould evaluate the performance by using the dollar-weighted return method. \\n˜e dollar-weighted return method can be used to determine the IRR of the \\nportfolio taking into consideration the cash ˝ows in and out of the account. \\nIf the investor will not be making additional contributions to or making \\nwithdrawals from the account the investor may use the time-weighted return \\nmethod to determine the IRR of the portfolio.\\n', '210\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nADDITIONAL WAYS TO MEASURE RETURNS\\nIn addition to the weighted returns discussed above, to provide additional \\nand comparable return data investors may look at the total return, the hold\\n-\\ning period return, and the annualized return.\\nTotal Return:\\n To determine the total return of an investment all dividend \\nor interest cash ˝ow must be taken into consideration. If the investment has \\nincreased in value, the sum of the cash ˝ow is added to any capital apprecia\\n-\\ntion. ˜e addition of the cash ˝ow will cause the total return to be higher. \\nIf the security has fallen in value the total of the cash ˝ow may partially or \\ntotally o˛set the loss of value of the security in question.\\nHolding Period Return:\\n ˜e holding period for a security may be very \\nlong or very short depending on the investor. Some investors hold securities \\nfor years while others may only hold securities for a few days or less. ˜e \\ntotal return from any cash ˝ow plus or minus any capital appreciation or \\ndepreciation realized during the time the investment was held equals the \\nholding period return.\\nAnnualized Return:\\n Once the holding period return has been calculated it \\ncan then be used to determine the annualized rate of return. An investment™s \\nannualized rate of return will allow investors to compare the investment™s \\nreturn against the performance of relevant benchmarks. If a security was \\nheld for less than 1 year its results would have to be multiplied to determine \\nan annualized rate of return. If the holding period was more than 1 year the \\nresults would have to be divided to determine the annualized rate of return. \\nExamples of total return, holding period return, and annualized return appear \\nas follows:\\nEXAMPLE \\n \\nSIA common stock appreciated 8% over an 18-month period and paid a 2% \\ncash dividend over the 18 months.\\n˜e total return in this case would be 10%, found by adding the 2% in \\ncash ˝ow to the 8% appreciation.\\n˜e holding period return would be 10% over the 18 months during which \\nthe investment was held.\\n˜e annualized return would be 6.66%, found by dividing the 10% return \\nby 1.5 as 18 months equals 1.5 years.\\n10 / 1.5 = 6.66\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n211\\nMODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY\\nAs money management developed over the last century, analysts began to \\nshi˙ their focus from the returns available from individual investments to \\nthe returns available from an entire portfolio. ˜is approach became known \\nas the modern portfolio theory. ˜e modern portfolio theory is based on the \\nconcept that investors are risk adverse. ˜rough diversi˚cation of invest\\n-\\nments and asset classes, portfolios can be constructed with higher levels of \\nexpected return for each unit of risk assumed. Asset classes are divided into \\nthree main categories: stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents. ˜rough \\nthe modern portfolio theory, portfolio managers can construct portfolios \\nbased on various allocations over the three main asset classes whose return \\nwill be the greatest given each unit of risk. ˜is level of optimal performance \\nis known as the eˆcient frontier. Any portfolio whose returns are expected \\nto be less than optimal are said to be operating behind the eˆcient frontier. \\nOptimal portfolio performance will be achieved by constructing a portfolio \\nwhose securities prices move independently of one another or whose prices \\nmove inversely to one another.\\nAllocating a client™s assets over various asset classes to achieve a given \\ninvestment objective is known as strategic asset allocation. As the investment \\nresults of the di˛erent asset classes vary over time, the assets may have to be \\nrebalanced. Asset rebalancing can be divided into two categories: systematic \\nrebalancing and active rebalancing. Systematic rebalancing is designed to \\nkeep the original asset allocation model in place. For example, if a client™s \\nportfolio is designed to be 70%/25%/5% in stocks, bonds, and cash respec\\n-\\ntively, as the percentages shi˙, the portfolio manager would rebalance the \\nassets to maintain the original percentages. Systematic rebalancing can be \\ndone at regular intervals such as quarterly or whenever the asset allocation \\nshi˙s by a certain percentage, such as by 5% or more. Active rebalancing \\nassumes that a portfolio manager can e˛ectively shi˙ the asset allocation to \\ntake advantage of shi˙s in the performance of the various asset classes. If an \\ninvestor has the same original portfolio allocation (70%/25%/5%) and the \\nportfolio manager thought that the bond market would outperform all other \\ninvestments, they may use tactical rebalancing to rebalance as 40%/55%/5%. \\nAlternatively, investors may elect to employ a buy-and-hold strategy and let \\nthe allocations go where they may. ˜is buy-and-hold strategy would reduce \\ntransaction costs and tax consequences.\\n', '212\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nPREDICTING PORTFOLIO INCOME\\nInvestors, especially in retirement, want to know how long their money \\nwill last given the fact they need to draw down on their savings to support \\ntheir lifestyle.

If the investor knows the \\ndesired income level to be provided and the interest rate the account will \\ngenerate, the lump sum needed to fund the account may be calculated. To \\ndetermine the lump sum needed, divide the annual income bene˚t by the \\nannual interest rate.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf an investor wanted to generate a monthly income of $2,000 in perpetuity \\nthe annual income bene˚t would be $24,000.

An investor who knows \\nthe interest rate that will be earned can simply divide 72 by that number to \\ndetermine how long it will take the principal to double.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor who has $10,000 invested at an annual rate of 8% would like to \\nknow when the value of the account will reach $20,000. ˜e answer is found \\nby simply dividing 72 by the interest rate of 8% as follows:\\n72 / 8 \\n˜\\n 9 years\\n˜e rule of 72 can also be used to calculate the rate of return on an invest\\n-\\nment given an initial value and a current value over time. If an investor placed \\n$10,000 into an account 12 years ago and the value of that account has grown \\nto $40,000, then the value has doubled twice. ˜e compound rate of return \\ncan be found by dividing 72 by the amount of time it took for the account to \\ndouble once.

In order to determine if there is a gain or loss, the investor must ˚rst \\ncalculate their cost basis or cost base. An investor™s cost base, in most cases, is \\nequal to the price they paid for the shares, plus any commissions or fees paid in \\nconnection with the purchase. An investor™s holding period begins the day a˙er \\nthe purchase date and ends on the day of sale. Once an investor knows their \\ncost base, calculating any gain or loss becomes easy. A capital gain is realized \\nwhen the investor sells the shares at a price that is greater than their cost base.\\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n215\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor who purchased a stock at $10 per share three years ago and \\nreceives $14 per share when they sell the shares has a $4 capital gain that is \\nfound by subtracting the cost base from the sales proceeds: $14\\n˝˚˝\\n$10 \\n˜\\n $4. \\nIf the investor had 1,000 shares, they would have a $4,000 capital gain.\\nAn investor™s cost base is always returned to them tax free. A capital loss \\nis realized when the investor sells the shares at a price that is less than their \\ncost base. If the investor in the previous example were to have sold the shares \\nat $8 instead of $14, the investor would have a $2 capital loss or a total capital \\nloss of $2,000 for the entire position.\\nAgain this is found by subtracting the cost base from the sales proceeds: \\n$8\\n˝˚˝\\n$10 \\n˜˝˚\\n$2.\\nCapital gains and losses are further classi˚ed as short-term or long-term \\ncapital gains or losses. Any gain or loss on an investment held for less than one \\nyear is classi˚ed as a short-term gain or loss. A short-term capital gain will be \\ntaxed as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains on assets held for more than \\none year will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. (˜is rule is subject to change.)\\nCOST BASE OF MULTIPLE PURCHASES\\nInvestors who have been accumulating shares through multiple purchases must \\ndetermine their cost base at the time of sale through one of the following methods:\\n\\n \\nF\\nirst in, ˚rst out (FIFO)\\n\\n \\nS\\nhare identi˚cation\\n\\n \\nA\\nverage cost\\nFIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO)\\nIf the investor does not identify which shares are being sold at the time of sale, \\nthe IRS will assume that the ˚rst shares that were purchased are the ˚rst shares \\nthat are sold under the FIFO method. In many cases, this will result in the \\nlargest capital gain and as a result, the investor will have the largest tax liability.\\nSHARE IDENTIFICATION\\nAt the time of the sale, an investor may specify which shares are being sold. \\nBy keeping a record of the purchase prices and the dates that the shares were \\npurchased, the investor may elect to sell the shares that create the most favor\\n-\\nable tax consequences.\\n', '216\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nAVERAGE COST\\nAn investor may decide to sell shares based on their average cost.

A net capital loss may be used to reduce \\nthe investor™s taxable ordinary income by up to $3,000 in the year in which it \\nis realized. Any net capital losses that exceed $3,000 may be carried forward \\ninto future years and may be deducted at a rate of $3,000 from ordinary \\nincome every year until the loss is used up. If the investor has a capital gain \\nin subsequent years, the investor may use the entire amount of the net capital \\nloss remaining to o˛set the gain up to the amount of the gain.\\nWASH SALES\\nAn investor may not sell a security at a loss and, shortly a˙er, repurchase \\nthe security (or a security that is substantially the same) to reestablish the \\nposition, if they intend to claim the loss for tax purposes and deduct the loss \\nfrom their ordinary income. ˜is is known as a wash sale and the IRS will \\ndisallow the loss.

With a revocable trust, the individual \\nwho established the trust and contributes assets to the trust, known as the \\ngrantor or settlor, may, as the name suggests, revoke the trust and take the \\nassets back. ˜e income generated by a revocable trust is generally taxed as \\nincome to the grantor. If the trust is irrevocable, the grantor may not revoke \\nthe trust and take the assets back. With an irrevocable trust, the trust usu\\n-\\nally pays the taxes as its own entity or the bene˚ciaries of the trust are taxed \\non the income they receive. If the trust is established as a simple trust all \\nincome generated by the trust must be distributed to the bene˚ciaries in \\nthe year the income is earned. If the trust is established as a complex trust \\nthe trust may retain some or all of the income earned and the trust will pay \\ntaxes on the income that is not distributed to the bene˚ciaries. ˜e grantor \\nof an irrevocable trust is generally not taxed on the income generated by the \\ntrust unless the assets in the trust are held for the bene˚t of the grantor, the \\ngrantor™s spouse, or if the grantor has an interest in the income of the trust of \\ngreater than 5%. While most trusts are established during a person™s lifetime \\n(known as an inter vivos trust) a trust may also be established to hold or to \\ndistribute assets a˙er a person™s death under the terms of their will. Trusts \\nthat are established under the terms of a will are known as testamentary \\ntrusts. All assets placed into a testamentary trust are subject to both estate \\ntaxes and probate. Trusts can be established to both protect assets from legal \\nclaims as well as for estate tax planning purposes. A bypass trust is one that \\nis established to reduce the tax liability of an estate le˙ to bene˚ciaries other \\nthan a spouse, such as to children. ˜e bypass trust allows the grantor to \\ntake advantage of the lifetime estate tax exclusion and allows individuals \\nwith signi˚cant wealth to reduce the tax burden to their heirs. A generational \\nskipping trust is a type of bypass trust that is established for the bene˚t of \\nrelatives more distant than one generation from the grantor such as grand \\nchildren or great grandchildren. ˜is type of bypass trust will allow assets to \\nbe passed on to grandchildren without ˚rst being passed to their parents and \\nwithout potentially being taxed again upon their parents death. Assets le˙ to \\n', 'CHAPTER 8\\n \\nR\\necommendations, Professional Conduct, and Taxation\\n \\n219\\ngrandchildren or unrelated persons more than 37.5 years younger than the \\ngrantor may be subject to a generation skipping transfer tax (GSTT).\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA grantor established a generational skipping trust to provide income to \\nhis children during their lifetime and leaving the principal to the grand\\n-\\nchildren upon the death of his children. Upon the death of the children the \\ngrandchildren would inherit the principal, sometimes known as the corpus \\nor body of the trust. At the time the grandchildren inherit the principal the \\nmoney would be subject to the generation skipping transfer tax. ˜e trustee \\nis responsible for paying the GSTT.\\nAn additional bene˚t of the generational skipping trust is it will allow for \\nthe assets to appreciate over time without triggering additional tax liability. If \\na grantor funds the trust with assets in an amount under the estate tax exclu\\n-\\nsion limit and the assets in the trust appreciate over time past the estate tax \\nexclusion limit a˙er the grantor™s death the assets will not be subject to estate \\ntaxes. A grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is yet one more way a trust \\ncan be established and used for estate planning. With this trust the grantor \\nplaces assets into the trust with the intention of drawing an income from the \\ntrust as an annuity payment for a set number of years. Upon the grantor™s \\ndeath the remainder of the principal will be le˙ to the bene˚ciaries. ˜e IRS \\ndetermines the value of the gi˙ to be the estimated value of the remainder \\nbased on IRS discount models. If the account earns more than this rate the \\nextra income will be added to the remaining principal le˙ to the bene˚ciaries.\\nTrust taxation can be a complex matter. ˜e income tax rate for net \\nincome received and retained by trusts can be subject to a very high rate of \\ntaxation and a relatively low level of net income. To avoid the high tax rate \\nmost trusts will be set up to distribute net income to the bene˚ciaries and \\nthe distribution will be taxable as income to the bene˚ciary. Should one of \\nthe bene˚ciaries to a trust die that person™s interest in the trust will usually \\npass to his or her children known as their issue per stirpes.\\nTrust and estates that retain net income must report that income to the \\nIRS on Form 1041.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nCapital gains on assets that are sold and reinvested as principal in the trust \\nare not taxable to the trust and are not considered part of net income to \\nthe trust.\\n', '220\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nGIFT TAXES\\nWhen gi˙s are made to family members or others individuals, the donor does \\nnot receive any tax deduction. ˜e donor™s cost base will transfer to the recipi\\n-\\nent for tax purposes.

In this chapter, we will \\nreview the rules and regulations that create the framework for securities \\nindustry regulation.\\nTHE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933\\n˜e Securities Act of 1933 was the ˚rst major piece of securities industry \\nregulation, which was brought about largely as a result of the stock market \\ncrash of 1929. Other laws also were enacted to help prevent another meltdown \\nof the nation™s ˚nancial system, such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \\nwhich will be discussed next.\\n˜e Securities Act of 1933 regulates the primary market. ˜e primary \\nmarket consists exclusively of transactions between issuers of securities and \\ninvestors. In a primary market transaction, the issuer of the securities receives \\nthe proceeds from the sale of the securities. ˜e Securities Act of 1933 requires \\nnonexempt issuers, typically corporate issuers, to ˚le a registration statement \\nwith the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). ˜e SEC will review the \\nregistration statement for a minimum of 20 days. During this time (known \\n', '228\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nas the cooling-o˛ period), no sales of securities may take place. If the SEC \\nrequires additional information regarding the o˛ering, the SEC may issue a \\nde˚ciency letter or a stop order that will extend the cooling-o˛ period beyond \\nthe original 20 days. ˜e cooling-o˛ period will continue until the SEC has \\nreceived all of the information it has requested. ˜e registration statementŠ\\nformally known as an S1Šis the issuer™s full-disclosure document for the \\nregistration of the securities with the SEC.\\nTHE PROSPECTUS\\nWhile the SEC is reviewing the securities™ registration statement, a registered \\nrepresentative is very limited as to what they may do with regard to the new \\nissue. During the cooling-o˛ period, the only thing a registered representa\\n-\\ntive may do is obtain indications of interest from clients by providing them \\nwith a preliminary prospectus, also known as a red herring. ˜e term red \\nherring originated from the fact that all preliminary prospectuses must have \\na statement printed in red ink on the front cover stating: ﬁ˜ese securities \\nhave not yet become registered with the SEC and therefore may not be sold.ﬂ \\nAn indication of interest is an investor™s or broker dealer™s statement that they \\nmay be interested in purchasing the securities being o˛ered. ˜e prelimi\\n-\\nnary prospectus must be delivered in hard copy to all interested parties. ˜e \\npreliminary prospectus contains most of the same information that will be \\ncontained in the ˚nal prospectus, except for the o˛ering price and the pro\\n-\\nceeds to the issuer. All information contained in a preliminary prospectus is \\nsubject to change or revision.\\nTHE FINAL PROSPECTUS\\nAll purchasers of new issues must be given a ˚nal prospectus before any sales \\nmay be allowed. ˜e ˚nal prospectus serves as the issuer™s full-disclosure \\ndocument for the purchaser of the securities. If the issuer has ˚led a prospec\\n-\\ntus with the SEC and the prospectus can be viewed on the SEC™s website, a \\nprospectus will be deemed to have been provided to the investor through the \\naccess equals delivery rule. Once the issuer™s registration statement becomes \\ne˛ective, the ˚nal prospectus must include:\\n\\n \\nT\\nype and description of the securities\\n\\n \\nPr\\nice of the security\\n\\n \\nU\\nse of the proceeds\\n', 'CHAPTER 9\\n \\nS\\necurities Industry Rules and Regulations\\n \\n229\\n\\n \\nU\\nnderwriter™s discount\\n\\n \\nD\\nate of o˛ering\\n\\n \\nT\\nype and description of underwriting\\n\\n \\nB\\nusiness history of issuer\\n\\n \\nBio\\ngraphical data for company o˝cers and directors\\n\\n \\nI\\nnformation regarding large stockholders\\n\\n \\nC\\nompany ˚nancial data\\n\\n \\nR\\nisks to purchaser\\n\\n \\nL\\negal matters concerning the company\\n\\n \\nSE\\nC disclaimer\\nSEC DISCLAIMER\\n˜e SEC reviews the issuer™s registration statement and the prospectus but \\ndoes not guarantee the accuracy or adequacy of the information. ˜e SEC \\ndisclaimer must appear on the cover of all prospectuses. It states: ﬁ˜ese secu\\n-\\nrities have not been approved or disapproved by the SEC nor have any repre\\n-\\nsentations been made about the accuracy or the adequacy of the information.ﬂ\\nMISREPRESENTATIONS\\nFinancial relief for misrepresentations made under the Securities Act of 1933 \\nis available for purchasers of any security that is sold under a prospectus that \\nis found to contain false or misleading statements. Purchasers of the security \\nmay be entitled to seek ˚nancial relief from any or all of the following:\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuer\\n\\n \\nU\\nnderwriters\\n\\n \\nO\\n˝cers and directors\\n\\n \\nA\\nll parties who signed the registration statement\\n\\n \\nA\\nccountants and attorneys who helped prepare the registration statement\\nIssuers may use forward-looking statements to provide details about \\nits future prospects to purchasers. ˜ese forward-looking statements must \\nbe identi˚ed by key words such as expect, predict, estimate, anticipate, or \\npotential. ˜ese words are used so that the reader clearly understands that \\nthe statements are management™s projections.\\n', '230\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTHE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\n˜e Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the second major piece of legislation \\nthat resulted from the market crash of 1929. ˜e Securities Exchange Act \\nregulates the secondary market that consists of investor-to-investor transac\\n-\\ntions. All transactions between two investors that are executed on any of the \\nexchanges or in the over-the-counter market are secondary market transac\\n-\\ntions. In a secondary market transaction, the selling security holder receives \\nthe money, not the issuing corporation. ˜e Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \\nalso regulates all individuals and ˚rms that conduct business in the securities \\nindustry. ˜e Securities Exchange Act of 1934:\\n\\n \\nC\\nreated the SEC\\n\\n \\nR\\nequires registration of broker dealers and agents\\n\\n \\nR\\negulates the exchanges and FINRA\\n\\n \\nR\\nequires net capital for broker dealers\\n\\n \\nR\\negulates short sales\\n\\n \\nR\\negulates insider transactions\\n\\n \\nR\\nequires public companies to solicit proxies\\n\\n \\nR\\nequires segregation of customer and ˚rm assets\\n\\n \\nA\\nuthorized the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the extension of credit \\nfor securities purchases under Regulation T\\n\\n \\nR\\negulates the handling of client accounts\\nTHE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)\\nOne of the biggest components of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the \\ncreation of the SEC. ˜e SEC is the ultimate securities industry authority and \\nis a direct government body. Five commissioners are appointed to ˚ve-year \\nterms by the president and each must be approved by the Senate. No more \\nthan three commissioners may be from any one political party. ˜e SEC is \\nnot a self-regulatory organization (SRO) or a designated examining authority \\n(DEA). A self-regulatory organization is one that regulates its own members \\nsuch as the NYSE or FINRA. A designated examining authority is one that \\ninspects a broker dealer™s books and records and also can be the NYSE or \\nFINRA. All broker dealers, exchanges, agents, and securities must register \\n', 'CHAPTER 9\\n \\nS\\necurities Industry Rules and Regulations\\n \\n231\\nwith the SEC. All exchanges are required to ˚le a registration statement with \\nthe SEC that includes the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and constitution. \\nAll new rules and regulations adopted by the exchanges must be disclosed \\nto the SEC as soon as they are enacted. Issuers of securities with more than \\n500 shareholders and with assets exceeding $5,000,000 must register with the \\nSEC, ˚le quarterly and annual reports, and must solicit proxies from stock\\n-\\nholders. A broker dealer who conducts business with the public must register \\nwith the SEC and maintain a certain level of ˚nancial solvency known as net \\ncapital. All broker dealers are required to forward a ˚nancial statement to all \\ncustomers of the ˚rm. Additionally, all employees of the broker dealer who \\nare involved in securities sales, have access to cash and securities, or who \\nsupervise employees must be ˚ngerprinted.\\nEXTENSION OF CREDIT\\n˜e Securities Act of 1934 gave the authority to the Federal Reserve Board \\n(FRB) to regulate the extension of credit by broker dealers for the purchase \\nof securities by their customers. ˜e following is a list of the regulations of \\nthe di˛erent lenders and the regulation that gave the FRB the authority to \\ngovern their activities:\\n\\n \\nR\\negulation T: broker dealers\\n\\n \\nR\\negulation U: banks\\n\\n \\nR\\negulation G: all other ˚nancial institutions\\nPUBLIC UTILITIES HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935\\n˜e Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935 regulates all companies \\nthat are in business to provide retail distribution of gas and electric power. \\nBecause the companies are regulated by this act, their securities are exempt \\nfrom state registration requirements.\\nFINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (FINRA)\\n˜e Maloney Act of 1938 was an amendment to the Securities Exchange \\nAct of 1934 that allowed the creation of the NASD. ˜e NASD, now part of \\nFINRA, is the self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter (OTC) \\n', '232\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nmarket and its purpose is to regulate the broker dealers who conduct business \\nin the OTC market.

Both federal and municipal issuers are exempt.\\nINVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940\\n˜e Investment Advisers Act of 1940 regulates industry professionals who \\ncharge a fee for the advice they o˛er to clients. ˜e Investment Advisers Act \\nsets forth registration requirements for advisers as well as disclosure require\\n-\\nments relating to the adviser™s:\\n\\n \\nM\\nethods of recommendations\\n\\n \\nT\\nypes of securities recommended\\n\\n \\nP\\nrofessional background and quali˚cations\\n\\n \\nF\\nees to be charged\\n\\n \\nM\\nethod for computing and charging fees\\n\\n \\nT\\nypes of clients\\n˜e Investment Advisers Act of 1940 prohibits an investment adviser \\nfrom disclosing client information to a third party without the client™s consent \\nunless the adviser is required or compelled to disclose the information by law.\\n', 'CHAPTER 9\\n \\nS\\necurities Industry Rules and Regulations\\n \\n233\\nINVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940\\n˜e Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates companies that are in busi\\n-\\nness to invest or reinvest money for the bene˚t of its investors. ˜e Invest\\n-\\nment Company Act sets forth registration requirements for the three types \\nof investment companies. ˜ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nM\\nanagement investment company\\n2.\\n \\nU\\nnit investment trust (UIT)\\n3.\\n \\nF\\nace amount company (FAC)\\nFINRA MEMBER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC\\nFINRA member ˚rms will seek to increase their business and exposure \\nthrough the use of both retail and institutional communications. ˜ere \\nare strict regulations in place in order to ensure all communications with \\nthe public adhere to industry guidelines.

FINRA Rule \\n2210 streamlines member communication rules and reduces the number of \\ncommunication categories from six to three. ˜e three categories of member \\ncommunication are:\\n1.\\n \\nR\\netail communication\\n2.\\n \\nI\\nnstitutional communications\\n3.\\n \\nC\\norrespondence\\nRETAIL COMMUNICATION\\nRetail communication is de˚ned as any written communication distributed \\nor made available to 25 or more retail investors in a 30-day period. ˜e \\ncommunication may be distributed in hard copy or in electronic formats. \\n˜e de˚nition of a retail investor is any investor who does not meet the \\nde˚nition of an institutional investor. Retail communications now contain \\nall components of advertising and sales literature. All retail communications \\nmust be approved by a registered principal prior to ˚rst use. ˜e publication \\nof a post in a chat room or other online forum will not require the prior \\napproval of a principal so long as such post does not promote the business \\nof the member ˚rm and does not provide investment advice. Additionally, \\ngeneric advertising will also be exempt from the prior approval require\\n-\\nments. All retail communication must be maintained by the member for \\nthree years. If the member ˚rm is a new member ˚rm, which has been in \\nexistence for less than 12 months based on the ˚rm™s approval date in the \\n', 'CHAPTER 9\\n \\nS\\necurities Industry Rules and Regulations\\n \\n235\\ncentral registration depository or CRD, the member must ˚le all retail com\\n-\\nmunications with FINRA 10 days prior to its ˚rst use unless the commu\\n-\\nnication has been previously ˚led and contains no material changes or has \\nbeen ˚led by another member such as investment company or ETF sponsor. \\nMember ˚rms that have been established for more than 12 months may \\n˚le retail communications with FINRA 10 days a˙er the communication \\nis ˚rst used. Investment companies, ETF sponsors, and retail communica\\n-\\ntions regarding variable annuities must be ˚led 10 days prior to ˚rst use. \\nIf the communication contains nonstandardized performance rankings. \\nShould FINRA determine that a member ˚rm is making false or mislead\\n-\\ning statements in its retail communications with the public, FINRA may \\nrequire the member to ˚le all of its retail communications with the public \\nwith the association 10 days prior to its ˚rst use.\\nINSTITUTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS\\nIntuitional communication is de˚ned as any written communication \\ndistributed or made available exclusively to institutional investors. ˜e \\ncommunication may be distributed in hard copy or in electronic formats. \\nInstitutional communications do not have to be approved by a principal \\nprior to ˚rst use so long as the member has established policies and proce\\n-\\ndures regarding the use of institutional communications and has trained \\nits employees on the proper use of institutional communication. Institu\\n-\\ntional communication is also exempt from FINRA™s ˚ling requirement but \\nlike retail communications it must be maintained by a member for three \\nyears. If the member believes that the institutional communication or any \\npart thereof may be seen by even a single retail investor the communica\\n-\\ntion must be handled as all other retail communication and is subject to \\nthe approval and ˚ling requirements as if it was retail communication. \\nAn institutional investor is a person or ˚rm that trades securities for his \\nor her own account or for the account of others. Institutional investors \\nare generally limited to large ˚nancial companies. Because of their size \\nand sophistication, fewer protective laws cover institutional investors. It \\nis important to note that there is no minimum size for an institutional \\naccount.

With \\nthe increase in acceptance of email as business communication, it would be \\nimpractical for a member to review all correspond\\n \\ne\\nnce between the mem\\n-\\nber and a customer. ˜e member instead may set up procedures to review a \\nsample of all correspondence, both electronic and hard copy. If the member \\nreviews only a sample of the correspondence, the member must train their \\nassociated people on their ˚rm™s procedures relating to correspondence and \\nmust document the training and ensure the procedures are followed. Even \\nthough the member is not required to review all correspondence, the member \\nmust still retain all correspondence. ˜e member should, where practical, \\nreview all incoming hard copy correspondence. Letters received by the ˚rm \\ncould contain cash, checks, securities, or complaints.\\nCORPORATE WEBSITES\\nNeither an investment adviser nor a broker dealer is deemed to have a \\nplace of business in a state where it does not maintain an o˝ce simply by \\nvirtue of the fact that the publicly available website established by the ˚rm \\nor one of its agents is accessible from that state so long as the following \\nconditions are met:\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne website clearly states that the ˚rm may only conduct business in states \\nwhere it is properly registered to do so.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne website only provides general information about the ˚rm and does \\nnot provide speci˚c investment advice.\\n', 'CHAPTER 9\\n \\nS\\necurities Industry Rules and Regulations\\n \\n237\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne ˚rm or its agent may not respond to Internet inquiries with the intent \\nto solicit business without ˚rst meeting the registration requirements in \\nthe state of the prospective customer.\\n˜e content of any website must be reviewed and approved by a principal \\nprior to its ˚rst use and must be ˚led with FINRA within 10 days of use.

Blind recruiting ads are the only form \\nof advertising that does not require the member™s name to appear in the \\nad. ˜e ads may not distort the opportunities or salaries of the advertised \\nposition. All other ads are required to disclose the name of the member \\n˚rm, as well as the relationship of the member to any other entities that \\nappear in the ad.\\nGENERIC ADVERTISING\\nGeneric advertising is generally designed to promote ˚rm awareness and \\nto advertise the products and services generally o˛ered through the ˚rm. \\nGeneric ads will generally include:\\n\\n \\nS\\necurities products o˛ered, i.e., stocks, bonds, mutual funds\\n\\n \\nC\\nontact name, number, and address\\n\\n \\nT\\nypes of accounts o˛ered, i.e., individual, IRA, 401K\\n', '238\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nTOMBSTONE ADS\\nA tombstone ad is an announcement of a new security o˛ering coming to \\nmarket.

A general security principal (Series 24) \\nmay approve most advertising and sales literature. Any advertising or sales \\nliterature relating to options must be approved by a registered option prin\\n-\\ncipal or the compliance registered options principal. Research reports must \\nbe approved by a supervisory analyst.\\nTESTIMONIALS\\nFrom time to time, broker dealers will use testimonials made by people of \\nnational or local recognition in an e˛ort to generate new business for the ˚rm. \\nIf the individual giving the testimonial is quoting past performance relating \\nto the ˚rm™s recommendations, it must be accompanied by a disclaimer that \\npast performance is not indicative of future performance.

Firms that sponsor seminars that are marketed \\nto investors as educational workshops o˙en provide attendees with a ﬁfree \\nlunchﬂ as a way to help market the seminar and state that ﬁno investment \\nproducts will be o˛ered or soldﬂ at the seminar. However, ˚rms who spon\\n-\\nsor these seminars clearly intend to establish a business relationship with the \\nattendees. ˜e ˚rms may try to get the attendees to open an account either at \\nthe seminar or during a follow-up solicitation to o˛er investment products. \\nFirms who sponsor so-called free lunch seminars must ensure that strict \\ncompliance procedures are followed by the agents who lead the seminars. \\nWithout strict compliance to conduct and disclosures rules NASAA consid\\n-\\ners ﬁfree lunchﬂ seminars a prohibited practice.

All broker dealers who are registered with the SEC are \\nrequired to be SIPC members. All broker dealers are required to pay annual \\ndues to SIPC™s insurance fund to cover losses due to broker dealer failure. \\nIf a broker dealer fails to pay their SIPC assessment, they may not transact \\nbusiness until it is paid.\\nNET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT\\nAll broker dealers are required to maintain a certain level of net capital in \\norder to ensure that they are ˚nancially solvent. A broker dealer™s capital \\nrequirement is contingent upon the type of business that the broker dealer \\nconducts. ˜e larger and more complex the ˚rm™s business is, the greater the \\nnet capital requirement.

Of the $500,000, up to \\n$250,000 may be in cash. Most broker dealers carry additional private \\ninsurance to cover larger accounts, but SIPC is the industry-funded insur\\n-\\nance and is required by all broker dealers.

If an account has \\nin excess of $250,000 in cash, the individual would not be covered for any \\namount exceeding $250,000 in cash and would become a general creditor \\nfor the rest. SIPC does not consider a margin account and cash account as \\nseparate customers and the customer would be covered for the maximum \\nof $500,000. SIPC does not o˛er coverage for commodities contracts and all \\nmember ˚rms must display the SIPC sign in the lobby of the ˚rm.\\nFIDELITY BOND\\nAll SIPC members are required to obtain a ˚delity bond to protect custom\\n-\\ners in the event of employee dishonesty.

Investor-to-\\ninvestor transactions are known as secondary market transactions. In a \\nsecondary market transaction, the selling security owner receives the \\nproceeds from the sale. Secondary market transactions may take place \\non an exchange or in the over-the-counter market known as Nasdaq. \\nWhile both facilitate the trading of securities, they operate in a very \\ndi˜erent manner. We will begin by looking at the types of orders that \\nan investor may enter and the reasons for entering the various types \\nof orders. Series 65 candidates can expect a number of questions on \\ntrading securities.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS\\nInvestors can enter various types of orders to buy or sell securities. Some \\norders guarantee that the investor™s order will be executed immediately. Other \\ntypes of orders may state a speci˜c price or condition under which the inves\\n-\\ntor wants their order to be executed. All orders are considered day orders \\nunless otherwise speci˜ed. All day orders will be canceled at the end of the \\ntrading day if they are not executed. An investor may also specify that their \\norder remain active until canceled. ˚is type of order is known as Good ™Til \\nCancel or GTC.\\n', '254\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nMARKET ORDERS\\nA market order will guarantee that the investor™s order is executed as soon \\nas the order is presented to the market. A market order to either buy or sell \\nguarantees the execution but not the price at which the order will be executed. \\nWhen a market order is presented for execution, the market for the security \\nmay be very di˛erent from the market that was displayed when the order \\nwas entered. As a result, the investor does not know the exact price at which \\ntheir order will be executed.\\nBUY LIMIT ORDERS\\nA buy limit order sets the maximum price that the investor will pay for the \\nsecurity. ˚e order may never be executed at a price higher than the investor™s \\nlimit price. Although a buy limit order guarantees that the investor will not \\npay over a certain price, it does not guarantee them an execution. If the stock \\ncontinues to trade higher away from the investor™s limit price, the investor \\nwill not purchase the stock and may miss a chance to realize a pro˜t.\\nSELL LIMIT ORDERS\\nA sell limit order sets the minimum price that the investor will accept for the \\nsecurity. ˚e order may never be executed at a price lower than the investor™s \\nlimit price. Although a sell limit order guarantees that the investor will not \\nreceive less than a certain price, it does not guarantee them an execution. If \\nthe stock continues to trade lower away from the investor™s limit price, the \\ninvestor will not sell the stock and may miss a chance to realize a pro˜t or \\nmay realize a loss as a result.\\n \\nFOCUS\\nPOINT\\n \\nIt™s important to remember that even if an investor sees stock trading at \\ntheir limit price, it does not mean that their order was executed, because \\nthere could have been stock ahead of them at that limit price.\\nSTOP ORDERS/STOP LOSS ORDERS\\nA stop order or stop loss order can be used by investors to limit or guard \\nagainst a loss or to protect a pro˜t. A stop order will be placed away from \\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n255\\nthe market in case the stock starts to move against the investor. A stop order \\nis not a live order; it has to be elected. A stop order is elected and becomes a \\nlive order when the stock trades at or through the stop price. ˚e stop price is \\nalso known as the trigger price. Once the stock has traded at or through the \\nstop price, the order becomes a market order to either buy or sell the stock \\ndepending on the type of order that was placed.\\nBUY STOP ORDERS\\nA buy stop order is placed above the market and is used to protect against a \\nloss or to protect a pro˜t on a short sale of stock. A buy stop order also could \\nbe used by a technical analyst to get long the stock a˝er the stock breaks \\nthrough resistance.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor has sold 100 shares of ABC short at $40 per share. ABC has \\ndeclined to $30 per share. ˚e investor is concerned that if ABC goes past \\n$32 it may return to $40. To protect their pro˜t, they enter an order to buy \\n100 ABC at 32 stop. If ABC trades at or through $32, the order will become \\na market order to buy 100 shares and the investor will cover their short at \\nthe next available price.\\nSELL STOP ORDERS\\nA sell stop order is placed below the market and is used to protect against \\na loss or to protect a pro˜t on the purchase of a stock. A sell stop order also \\ncould be used by a technical analyst to get short the stock a˝er the stock \\nbreaks through support.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn investor has purchased 100 shares of ABC at $30 per share. ABC has risen \\nto $40 per share. ˚e investor is concerned that if ABC falls past $38, it may \\nreturn to $30. To protect their pro˜t, they enter an order to sell 100 ABC at 38 \\nstop. If ABC trades at or through $38, the order will become a market order \\nto sell 100 shares and the investor will sell their short at the next available \\nprice.\\nConsider the same example if the order to sell 100 ABC at 38 stop was \\nentered GTC. We could have a situation such as this:\\nABC closes at 39.40. ˚e following morning, ABC announces that they \\nlost a major contract and ABC opens at 35.30. ˚e opening print of 35.30 \\nelected the order and the stock would be sold on the opening or as close to \\nthe opening as practical.\\n', '256\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSTOP LIMIT ORDERS\\nAn investor would enter a stop limit order for the same reasons they would \\nenter a stop order. ˚e only di˛erence is that once the order has been elected, \\nthe order becomes a limit order instead of a market order. ˚e same risks \\nthat apply to traditional limit orders apply to stop limit orders. If the stock \\ncontinues to trade away from the investor™s limit, they could give back all of \\ntheir pro˜ts or su˛er large losses.\\nOTHER TYPES OF ORDERS\\n˚ere are several other types of orders that an investor may enter. ˚ey are:\\n\\n \\nA\\nll or none (AON)\\n\\n \\nI\\nmmediate or cancel (IOC)\\n\\n \\nF\\nill or kill (FOK)\\n\\n \\nN\\not held (NH)\\n\\n \\nM\\narket on open/market on close\\nAll or None Orders:\\n ˚ese orders may be entered as day orders or GTC. \\nAs the name implies, all or none orders indicate that the investor wants to \\nbuy or sell all of the securities or none of them. All or none orders are not \\ndisplayed in the market because the required special handling and the inves\\n-\\ntor will not accept a partial execution.\\nImmediate or Cancel Orders:\\n ˚e investor wants to buy or sell whatever \\nthey can immediately and whatever is not ˜lled is canceled.\\nFill or Kill Orders:\\n ˚e investor wants the entire order executed imme\\n-\\ndiately or the entire order canceled.\\nNot Held Orders:\\n ˚e investor gives discretion to the ˙oor broker as to \\nthe time and price of execution. All retail not held orders given to a represen\\n-\\ntative are considered day orders unless the order is received in writing from \\nthe customer and entered GTC.\\nMarket on Open/Market on Close Orders:\\n ˚e investor wants their order \\nexecuted on the opening or closing of the market or as reasonably close to \\nthe opening or closing as practical. If the order is not executed, it is canceled. \\nPartial executions are allowed.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nThe SEC has granted permission to the NYSE to stop using FOK and IOC \\norders.\\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n257\\nTHE EXCHANGES\\n˚e most recognized stock exchange in the world is the New York Stock \\nExchange or the NYSE. ˚ere are, however, many exchanges throughout \\nthe United States that all operate in a similar manner. Exchanges are dual-\\nauction markets. ˚ey provide a central market place where buyers and sell\\n-\\ners come together in one centralized location to compete with one another. \\nBuyers compete with other buyers to be the highest price anyone is willing \\nto pay for the security and sellers compete with other sellers to be the low\\n-\\nest price at which anyone is willing to sell a security. All transactions in \\nan exchange-listed security that are executed on the exchange have to take \\nplace in front of the specialist or designated marker maker (DMM) for that \\nsecurity. ˚e specialist/DMM is an exchange member who is responsible for \\nmaintaining a fair and orderly market for the stock in which they specialize. \\n˚e specialist/DMM stands at the trading ﬁpostﬂ where all the buyers and \\nsellers must go to conduct business in the security. ˚is is responsible for the \\ncrowd that you see on the news and ˜nancial reports when they show the \\n˙oor of the exchange. All securities that trade on an exchange are known \\nas listed securities.\\nPRIORITY OF EXCHANGE ORDERS\\nOrders that are routed to the trading post for execution are prioritized accord\\n-\\ning to price and time. If the price of more than one order is the same, orders \\nwill be ˜lled as follows:\\n\\n \\nP\\nriority:\\n ˚e order that was received ˜rst gets ˜lled ˜rst.\\n\\n \\nP\\nrecedence:\\n If the time and price are the same, the larger order gets ˜lled.\\n\\n \\nP\\narity:\\n If all conditions are the same, the orders are matched in the crowd \\nand the shares are split among the orders.\\nTHE ROLE OF THE SPECIALIST/DMM\\n˚e specialist is an independent exchange member who has been assigned \\na stock or group of stocks for which they are the designated market maker \\n(DMM). ˚ey are responsible for:\\n\\n \\nM\\naintaining a fair and orderly market for the securities\\n\\n \\nB\\nuying for their own account in the absence of public buy orders\\n', '258\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\nS\\nelling from their own account in the absence of public sell orders\\n\\n \\nA\\ncting as an agent by executing public orders le˝ with them\\nA large amount of capital is required in order to ful˜ll the requirements \\nof a specialist/DMM. As a result, most specialists/DMMs are employees \\nof specialist ˜rms. Although the specialist is not required to participate in \\nevery transaction, every transaction for that security that is executed on the \\nexchange must take place in front of the specialist. ˚e specialist may act as \\neither an agent or as a principal if they play a role in the transaction.\\nTHE SPECIALIST/DMM ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL\\nIn the absence of public orders the specialist/DMM is required to provide \\nliquidity and price improvement for the stocks in which they are the des\\n-\\nignated market maker. Specialists/DMMs are required to trade against the \\nmarket and may now trade for their own account at prices that would compete \\nwith public orders.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nIf the public market for XYZ is quoted as follows:\\nBid\\nO˜er\\n10\\n˜˚˜\\n10\\n20.45\\n20.55\\n˚ere is a 20.45 bid for 1000 shares and 1000 shares o˛ered at 20.55.\\nIf a public sell order came in to sell the stock, the DMM could purchase \\nthe stock for their own account at 20.45 because they are on parity with the \\npublic. ˚e DMM could also purchase the stock for their own account at \\n20.50 and would be improving the price that the seller would be receiving. \\n˚is is known as price improvement. Alternatively, if a public buy order \\ncame in, the specialist/DMM could sell the stock from their own account at \\n20.55, because they are now allowed to compete with the public. ˚ey could \\nalso sell the stock to the customer at 20.50 because, once again, that would \\nbe providing price improvement for the order.\\nTHE SPECIALIST/DMM ACTING AS AN AGENT\\n˚e specialist/DMM is also required to execute orders that have been le˝ \\nwith them. Orders that have been le˝ with the specialist/DMM for execution \\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n259\\nare said to be le˝ or dropped on the specialist™s/DMM™s book. ˚e specialist/\\nDMM is required to maintain a book of public orders and to execute them \\nwhen market conditions permit. ˚e types of orders that may be le˝ with \\nthe specialist are:\\n\\n \\nB\\nuy and sell limit orders\\n\\n \\nSto\\np orders\\n\\n \\nS\\ntop limit orders\\n\\n \\nB\\noth day and GTC orders\\n\\n \\nAO\\nN orders\\n˚e specialist/DMM will execute the orders if and when they are able \\nto and will send a commission bill to the member who le˝ the order with \\nthem for execution. ˚is is known as a specialist bill and is usually only a \\ncent or two per share. ˚e specialist/DMM is also required to quote the best \\nmarket for the security to any party that asks. ˚e best or inside market is \\ncomprised of the highest bid and lowest o˛er. ˚is is made up from bids and \\no˛ers contained in the specialist™s/DMM™s book and in the trading crowd. \\n˚e inside market is also the market that is displayed to broker dealers and \\nagents on their quote system.\\nWhen quoting the inside market, the specialist/DMM will add all \\nof the shares bid for at the highest price and all of the shares o˛ered at \\nthe lowest price to determine the size of the market. ˚ere are certain types \\nof orders that are not included when determining the inside market; they are:\\n\\n \\nSto\\np orders\\n\\n \\nAO\\nN orders\\nA specialist/DMM may not accept the following types of orders:\\n\\n \\nMa\\nrket orders\\n\\n \\nI\\nmmediately executable limit orders\\n\\n \\nN\\not held orders\\n\\n \\nI\\nmmediate or cancel orders\\n\\n \\nF\\nill or kill orders\\nMarket orders and immediately executable limit orders are ˜lled as soon \\nas they reach the crowd so there is nothing to leave with the specialist.

In order for the ˙oor \\nbroker to cross the stock, the specialist/DMM must allow it and the ˙oor \\nbroker must announce the orders in an e˛ort to obtain price improvement \\nfor the orders. ˚e ˙oor broker must o˛er the stock for sale at a price above \\nthe current best bid and may purchase the stock using the buy order if no \\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n261\\nprice improvement has been o˛ered. ˚is then will complete the cross and \\nboth orders will be ˜lled.\\nDO NOT REDUCE (DNR)\\nGTC orders that are placed underneath the market and le˝ with the specialist/\\nDMM for execution will be reduced for the distribution of dividends. Orders \\nthat will be reduced are:\\n\\n \\nB\\nuy limits\\n\\n \\nS\\nell stops\\n˚ese orders are reduced because when a stock goes ex dividend, its price \\nis adjusted down. To ensure that customer orders placed below the market are \\nonly executed as a result of market activity, the order will be adjusted down \\nby the value of the dividend.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA customer has placed an order to buy 500 XYZ at 35 GTC. XYZ closed \\nyesterday at 36.10. XYZ goes ex dividend for 20 cents and opens the next day \\nat 35.90. ˚e customer™s order will now be an order to purchase 500 XYZ at \\n34.80 GTC.\\nIf the customer had entered the order and speci˜ed that the order was \\nnot to be reduced for the distribution of ordinary dividends, it would have \\nremained an order to purchase 500 shares at 35. ˚e order in this case would \\nhave been entered as:\\nBuy 500 XYZ 35 GTC DNR\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nOrders placed above the market such as sell limits and buy stops are not \\nreduced for distributions.\\nADJUSTMENTS FOR STOCK SPLITS\\nGTC orders that are le˝ with the specialist must be adjusted for stock splits. \\nOrders that are placed above and below the market will be adjusted so that \\nthe aggregate dollar value of the order remains the same.\\n', '262\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA customer has placed a GTC order. Let™s look at what happens to the order \\nif the company declares a stock split:\\nType of Split\\nOld Order\\nNew Order\\n2:1\\nBuy 100 at 50\\nBuy 200 at 25\\n2:1\\nSell 100 at 100\\nSell 200 at 50\\n3:2\\nBuy 100 at 100\\nBuy 150 at 66.67\\n3:2\\nSell 100 at 60\\nSell 150 at 40\\nNotice that in all of the examples, the value of the customer™s order \\nremained the same. To calculate the adjustment to an open order for a for\\n-\\nward stock split, multiply the number of shares by the fraction and the share \\nprice by the reciprocal of the fraction. Such as:\\nBuy 100 at 50 a˚er a two-to-one stock split\\n100\\n˜˚˜\\n2/1 \\n˛\\n 200\\n50\\n˜˚˜\\n1/2 \\n˛\\n 25\\n˚e value of the order was $5,000 both before and a˝er the order.\\nSTOPPING STOCK\\nAs a courtesy to a public customer, a specialist/DMM may guarantee an \\nexecution price while trying to ˜nd an improved or better price for the public \\ncustomer. ˚is is known as stopping stock if an order comes in to the crowd \\nto purchase 500 ABC at the market when ABC is quoted as follows:\\nBid\\nAsk\\n15\\n˜˚˜\\n20\\n40\\n40.20\\nIf the specialist/DMM stopped the customer, they would guarantee that \\nthe customer would pay no more than 40.20 for the 500 shares. ˚e special\\n-\\nist then would try to obtain a better price for the customer and would try to \\nattract a seller by displaying a higher bid for that customer™s order. ABC may \\nnow be quoted a˝er the specialist/DMM stopped the stock as:\\nBid\\nAsk\\n5\\n˜˚˜\\n20\\n40.10\\n40.20\\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n263\\nIn this case, the specialist/DMM is trying to buy the stock for the customer \\n10 cents cheaper than the current best o˛er. If, however, a buyer comes into \\nthe crowd and purchases the stock that is o˛ered at 40.20, the specialist must \\nsell the customer 500 shares from their own account no higher than 40.20.\\nCOMMISSION HOUSE BROKER\\nA commission house broker is an employee of a member organization and will \\nexecute orders for the member™s customers and for the member™s own account.\\nTWO-DOLLAR BROKER\\nA two-dollar broker is an independent member who will execute orders for \\ncommission house brokers when they are too busy managing other orders.\\nREGISTERED TRADERS\\nA registered trader is an exchange member who trades for their own account \\nand for their own pro˜t and loss. Orders may not originate on the ˙oor of \\nthe NYSE; however, registered traders are active on other exchanges such as \\nthe Amex (now part of NYSE). A supplemental liquidity provider/SLP is an \\no˛-the-˙oor market maker that directs orders to the ˙oor of the NYSE for its \\nown account. ˚e SLP may compete with the DMM for order execution and \\nmust display a bid or o˛er at least 5% of the time. ˚e SLP will receive a rebate \\nfrom the NYSE when an order is executed against the SLP™s quote that added \\nliquidity to the market. Allied members of the NYSE are given direct phone \\nand electronic access to the trading ˙oor but may not trade on the ˙oor itself.\\nSUPER DISPLAY BOOK (SDBK)\\nMost customer orders will never be handled by a ˙oor broker. Floor brokers \\nusually only handle the large complex institutional orders. Customer orders \\nwill be electronically routed directly to the trading post for execution via the \\nsuper display book system. ˚e super display book bypasses the ˙oor broker \\nand sends the order right to the specialist/DMM for execution. If the order can \\nbe immediately executed, the system will send an electronic con˜rmation of \\nthe execution to the submitting broker dealer. All listed securities are eligible \\n', '264\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nto be traded over the super display book system. All preopening orders that \\ncan be matched up are automatically paired o˛ by the system and executed \\nat the opening price. Any preopening orders that cannot be paired o˛ are \\nrouted to the trading post for inclusion on the display book.\\nSHORT SALES\\nAn investor who believes that a stock price has appreciated too far and is \\nlikely to decline may pro˜t from this belief by selling the stock short. In a \\nshort sale, the customer borrows the security in order to complete delivery to \\nthe buying party. ˚e investor sells the stock high hoping that they can buy it \\nback cheaper and replace it. It is a perfectly legitimate investment strategy. ˚e \\ninvestor™s ˜rst transaction is a sell and they exit the position by repurchasing \\nthe stock. ˚e short sale of stock has unlimited risk because there is no limit \\nto how high the stock price may go. ˚e investor will lose money if the stock \\nappreciates past their sales price.\\nREGULATION OF SHORT SALES/REGULATION SHO\\n˚e SEC continues to adopt new rules relating to the short sale of securities. \\nRegulation SHO has been adopted to update prior short sale regulations and \\ncovers:\\n\\n \\nD\\ne˜nitions and order marking\\n\\n \\nS\\nuspension of uptick and plus bid requirements\\n\\n \\nB\\norrowing and delivery requirements for securities\\nUnder Regulation SHO, the SEC has prohibited any SRO from adopting \\nany price criteria as a requirement of executing a short sale.\\nRULE 200 DEFINITIONS AND ORDER MARKING\\nRule 200 updates the de˜nition of who is determined to be long a security. \\nAs new derivatives and trading systems and strategies have been introduced, \\namendments to the short sale rules under the Securities Exchange Act of \\n1934 needed to be updated. Most of the prior rules and de˜nitions remain \\nunchanged. ˚e new updates under Rule 200 are:\\n\\n \\nA p\\nerson is considered long the security if they hold a security future con\\n-\\ntract and have been noti˜ed that they will receive the underlying security.\\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n265\\n\\n \\nA b\\nroker dealer must aggregate its net positions in securities unless it \\nquali˜es to allow each independent trading unit to aggregate its positions \\nindependently.\\nA broker dealer may qualify to have its various trading departments \\ndetermine their net long or short positions independently if:\\n\\n \\nT\\nraders are only assigned to one independent trading unit at any one time.\\n\\n \\nT\\nraders in each independent trading unit employ their own trading strategies \\nand do not coordinate their trading with other independent trading units.\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne ˜rm has documented each aggregation unit and the independent \\ntrading objectives of each unit.\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne ˜rm supports the independent nature of each trading unit.\\n\\n \\nA\\nt the time a sell order is entered, each independent aggregation unit \\ndetermines its net position for the security.\\n˚e order marking requirements of Rule 200 require the broker dealer to \\nmark all orders long, short, or short exempt. ˚e de˜nition of long and short \\ninclude the de˜nitions in the aˆrmative determination rule and have been \\nexpanded to include the following:\\n\\n \\nA\\nn order may be marked long if the investor or broker dealer have pos\\n-\\nsession of the security and can reasonably be expected to deliver the \\nsecurity by settlement date.\\n\\n \\nA\\nn order must be marked short if the investor or broker dealer have pos\\n-\\nsession of the security but cannot reasonably be expected to deliver the \\nsecurity by settlement date.\\n\\n \\nA\\nn order does not need to be marked short exempt if the seller is only \\nrelying on a price test exemption under the tick test or bid test rule.\\nRULE 203 SECURITY BORROWING AND \\nDELIVERY REQUIREMENTS\\nA broker dealer may not accept an order to sell short an equity security for \\nthe account of a customer or for its own account without having borrowed \\nthe security, having arranged to borrow the security, or without having a \\nreasonable belief that the security can be borrowed. A broker dealer can rely \\non an easy-to-borrow list of securities as long as the list is less than 24 hours \\nold. For sell orders that were marked long, the broker dealer must deliver the \\n', '266\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nsecurities by settlement date and may not borrow the securities to complete \\ndelivery. However, a broker dealer may borrow securities to complete delivery \\nunder the following exceptions:\\n\\n \\nT\\no complete delivery to the buyer when a customer fails to deliver.\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne security is being loaned to another broker dealer.\\n\\n \\nA f\\nail to deliver resulting from a good-faith mistake and a buy-in would \\ncreate an undue hardship.\\nA broker dealer must close out all customer fails to deliver within 35 days \\nof the trade date. ˚e broker dealer must borrow the securities or buy in the \\nsecurities of a like kind and quantity.\\nA broker dealer is exempt from the locating requirements for short sales if:\\n\\n \\n˚\\ne broker dealer has accepted an order to sell short an equity security \\n \\nfrom another broker dealer. ˚e broker dealer entering the order is \\nrequired to locate the securities unless the broker dealer accepting the \\norder has a contractual obligation to comply.\\n\\n \\nT\\nransactions in securities futures.\\n\\n \\nT\\nransactions that are executed in accordance with bona ˜de market \\nmaking.\\n\\n \\nT\\nransactions executed by a specialist, block positioner, or dealer.\\n\\n \\nA\\nn order in which the customer has been determined to be long and will \\ndeliver the security when restrictions have been removed or expired. ˚e \\nseller must deliver the securities within 35 calendar days.

All reports are required \\nto be ˜led with the ˜rm™s designated examining authority (FINRA or NYSE) \\nby the end of the second business day following the settlement date.\\nOVER THE COUNTER/NASDAQ\\nSecurities that are not listed on any of the centralized exchanges trade over \\nthe counter or on the Nasdaq. Nasdaq stands for National Association of \\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n267\\nSecurities Dealers Automated Quotation System. It is the interdealer network \\nof computers and phone lines that allows securities to be traded between bro\\n-\\nker dealers. Nasdaq is not an auction market but has been granted exchange \\nstatus by the SEC. It is a negotiated market. One broker dealer negotiates a \\nprice directly with another broker dealer. None of the other interested parties \\nfor that particular security have any idea of what terms are being proposed. \\n˚e broker dealers may communicate over their Nasdaq workstations or can \\nspeak directly to one another over the phone.\\nMARKET MAKERS\\nBecause there are no specialists for the over-the-counter markets, bids and \\no˛ers are displayed by broker dealers known as market makers. A mar\\n-\\nket maker is a ˜rm that is required to display a two-sided market. A two-\\nsided market consists of a simultaneous bid and o˛er for the security quoted \\nthrough the Nasdaq workstation. ˚e market maker must be willing to buy \\nthe security at the bid price, which they have displayed, as well as be willing \\nto sell the security at the o˛ering price, which they have displayed. ˚ese are \\nknown as ˜rm quotes. ˚ere is no centralized location for the Nasdaq market; \\nit is simply a network of computers that connects broker dealers throughout \\nthe world. Market makers purchase the security at the bid price and sell the \\nsecurity at the o˛ering price. ˚eir pro˜t is the di˛erence between the bid \\nand the o˛er known as the spread. Rule changes and new trading systems \\nknown as ECNs, or electronic communication networks, have narrowed the \\nspreads on stocks signi˜cantly in recent years.\\nNASDAQ SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS\\nBroker dealers will subscribe to the Nasdaq workstation services that meet \\ntheir ˜rm™s requirements. ˚e levels of service are:\\nLevel I:\\n Nasdaq Level I subscription service only provides informa\\n-\\ntion relating to the inside market and provides quotes for registered \\nrepresentatives.\\nLevel II:\\n Nasdaq Level II subscription service is for broker dealers that \\nare order-entry ˜rms. Level II allows the broker dealer to see the inside \\nmarket, as well as the quotes of all market makers and to execute orders \\nover the Nasdaq workstation.\\n', '268\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nLevel III:\\n Nasdaq Level III is the highest level of service o˛ered over the \\nNasdaq workstation. Level III contains all of the features of Level II and \\nallows the ˜rm to enter and update their own markets. Level III is only \\nfor approved market makers.\\nNasdaq TotalView:\\n Nasdaq TotalView quotation service allows profes\\n-\\nsionals and nonprofessionals to view the entire Nasdaq book for securities \\ntraded over Nasdaq. TotalView displays the price and size quoted by all \\nmarket makers, exchanges, and ECNs. TotalView also displays the total \\nsize of the market for the ˜ve best priced quotes as well as order imbal\\n-\\nance information for all Nasdaq crossing sessions.\\nNASDAQ QUOTES\\nMost actively traded Nasdaq stocks are quoted by a large number of market \\nmakers. As market makers enter their quotes, some will be above or below \\nthe inside market. A market maker whose quote is above or below the inside \\nmarket is said to be away from the market. As the market makers adjust their \\nquotes, the market maker who is publishing the highest bid for the security \\nhas their bid displayed at the top of the list and their bid is published as the \\nbest bid to anyone with a Nasdaq Level I subscription. ˚e market maker \\npublishing the lowest o˛er will have their o˛er listed at the top of the list and \\npublished as the lowest o˛er to anyone with a Nasdaq Level I subscription. \\nAs a result, the best bid and o˛er from any two market makers will make up \\nthe inside market.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\n \\nXY\\nAD\\n \\nBi\\nd\\n \\nA\\nsk\\n \\n15.00\\n \\n15\\n.05\\nMM 1\\n14.90\\n15.10\\nMM 2\\n15.00\\n15.20\\nMM 3\\n14.85\\n15.05\\nMM 4\\n14.95\\n15.15\\nMM 5\\n14.98\\n15.18\\nNote:\\n Notice how the inside market for XYAD consists of the bid from \\nmarket maker 2 and the o˛er from market maker 3. All of the other market \\nmakers are away from the market.\\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n269\\nNOMINAL NASDAQ QUOTES\\nAll quotes published over the Nasdaq workstation are ˜rm quotes. A dealer \\nwho fails to honor their quotes has committed a violation known as backing \\naway. Dealers who provide quotes over the phone that are clearly indicated \\nas being subject or nominal cannot be held to trade at those prices.

A ˜rm quote is always \\ngood for at least one round lot or 100 shares.\\nNASDAQ EXECUTION SYSTEMS\\nMost Nasdaq trades are executed over the Nasdaq workstation using one of its \\nautomated execution systems. ˚ese systems allow dealers to execute orders \\nwithout having to speak with one another on the phone.\\nNASDAQ MARKET CENTER EXECUTION SYSTEM (NMCES)\\n˚e Nasdaq Market Center Execution System also known as NMCES accepts \\nmarket orders and immediately executable limit orders for both customer and \\n˜rm accounts. Orders may be entered for up to 999,999 shares per order. ˚e \\norders will immediately be routed to dealers on the inside market for auto\\n-\\nmatic execution. Larger orders may be split up to meet the maximum order \\nvolume. However, a broker dealer may not split orders that would otherwise \\nbe able to be entered into the Nasdaq system in an e˛ort to increase fees or \\nrebates. ˚is would be considered order shredding and is a violation. Orders \\nexecuted through the Nasdaq execution system are automatically reported \\nto ACT.\\n', '270\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nNASDAQ OPENING CROSS\\n˚e Nasdaq opening cross begins at 9:28 \\nˇ˘\\n. At this time, the Nasdaq execu\\n-\\ntion system automatically executes orders. Orders placed a˝er 9:28 \\nˇ˘\\n may \\nnot be canceled. Orders placed a˝er 9:28 \\nˇ˘\\n may be changed only if the change \\nto the order makes the order more aggressive. A change that increases the size \\nof the order or improves the price would make the order more aggressive. For \\na buy order, an improved price would be a higher limit price; for a sell order, \\nan improved price would be a lower limit price. ˚e opening cross creates the \\nNasdaq oˆcial opening price (NOOP). Like the opening cross, Nasdaq has \\ndeveloped the closing cross to determine the Nasdaq oˆcial closing price.\\nNON-NASDAQ OTCBB\\n˚e OTC bulletin board provides two-sided electronic quotes for OTC secu\\n-\\nrities that cannot meet the listing standard of an exchange or Nasdaq. DPPs \\nand ADRs will o˝en be quoted on the OTCBB.\\nPINK OTC\\nSecurities that do not qualify for listing on the Nasdaq, or that have been \\ndelisted from Nasdaq or one of the exchanges, may be quoted on the Pink \\nOTC. ˚e Pink OTC Market is operated as an electronic marketplace. ˚e \\nPink Sheets displayed in the Pink OTC Market are ˜rm quotes. ˚e Pink OTC \\nMarket also provides a list of phone numbers for market makers who display \\nsubject quotes. Stocks quoted on the Pink OTC Market trading at under $5 \\nper share are known as penny stocks. A ˜rm that executes a customer™s order \\nfor a Pink OTC security is required to make a reasonable e˛ort to obtain the \\nbest price for the customer. ˚e ˜rm is required to obtain quotes from at \\nleast three market makers for the security prior to executing the customer™s \\norder. If the security has less than three market makers, the ˜rm is required \\nto obtain a quote from all market makers.\\nTHIRD MARKET\\n˚e third market consists of transactions in exchange-listed securities exe\\n-\\ncuted over the counter through the Nasdaq workstation. A broker dealer \\nmay wish to simply purchase or sell an exchange-listed security directly \\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n271\\nwith another brokerage ˜rm instead of executing the order on the ˙oor of \\nthe exchange. ˚ese transactions are known as third-market transactions. \\nAll third-market transactions are reported through TRF to the consolidated \\ntape for display.\\nFOURTH MARKET\\nA fourth-market transaction is a transaction between two large institutions \\nwithout the use of a broker dealer. ˚e computer network that facilitates these \\ntransactions is known as INSTINET. Large blocks of stock, both listed and \\nunlisted, trade between large institutional investors in the fourth market. \\nWhile many trades in the fourth market are executed through the INSTINET \\nsystem, many large portfolio managers execute internal crosses that go unre\\n-\\nported. Proprietary trading systems are not considered part of the fourth \\nmarket because these systems are either registered as broker dealers or are \\noperated by broker dealers.\\nBROKER VS. DEALER\\n˚e term broker dealer actually refers to the two capacities in which a ˜rm may \\nact when executing a transaction. When a ˜rm is acting as a broker, it is acting as \\nthe customer™s agent and is merely executing the customer™s order for a fee known \\nas a commission. ˚e role of the broker is simply to ˜nd someone willing to buy \\nthe investor™s securities if the customer is selling or to ˜nd someone willing to sell \\nthem the securities if they are buyers. ˚e ˜rm acts as a dealer when it participates \\nin the transaction by taking the opposite side of the trade. For example, the ˜rm \\nmay ˜ll a customer™s buy order by selling the securities to the customer from the \\n˜rm™s own account or the dealer may ˜ll the customer™s sell order by buying the \\nsecurities for their own account. A brokerage ˜rm is always acting as a dealer or \\nin a principal capacity when it is making markets over the counter.\\nBroker\\nDealer\\nExecutes customer™s orders\\nParticipates in the trade as a principal\\nCharges a commission\\nCharges a markup or markdown \\nMust disclose the amount of the \\ncommission\\nMakes a market in the security  \\nMust disclose the fact that they are a \\nmarket maker, but not the amount of the \\nmarkup or markdown\\n', '272\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nFINRA 5% MARKUP POLICY\\nFINRA has set a guideline to ensure that the prices investors pay and receive \\nfor securities are reasonably related to the market for the securities. As a general \\nrule, FINRA considers a charge of 5% to be reasonable. ˚e 5% policy is a guide\\n-\\nline, not a rule. Factors that go toward what is considered reasonable are the:\\n\\n \\nPr\\nice of the security\\n\\n \\nV\\nalue of the transaction\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of security\\n\\n \\nV\\nalue of the member™s services\\n\\n \\nE\\nxecution expenses\\nWhen a customer is executing an order for a low price or low total dol\\n-\\nlar amount, a ˜rm™s minimum commission may be greater than 5% of the \\ntransaction.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nA customer wants to purchase 1,000 shares of XYZ at $1. If the ˜rm™s mini\\n-\\nmum commission is $100, that would be 10% of the tradeŠbut in this case, \\nit would be acceptable.\\nStocks generally carry a higher degree of risk than bonds and, as a result, \\nstocks justify a higher commission or pro˜t to the dealer. Full-service ˜rms \\nmay be able to justify a larger commission simply based on the value of the \\nservices they provide.\\nMARKUPS/MARKDOWNS WHEN ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL\\nA ˜rm that executes customer orders on a principal basis is entitled to a \\npro˜t on those transactions. If the ˜rm is selling the security to the customer, \\nthey will charge the customer a markup. In the case of the ˜rm buying the \\nsecurities from the customer, they will charge the customer a markdown. \\n˚e amount of the markup or markdown that a ˜rm charges the customer \\nis based on the inside market for the security.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nLet™s assume that the brokerage ˜rm is a market maker in ABCD. In the \\nmorning, the ˜rm purchased shares of ABCD for its own account at 9.50. \\n˚e stock has been trading higher all day and is now quoted as follows:\\nBid\\n \\nA\\nsk\\n10.00\\n \\n10.05\\n', 'CHAPTER 10\\n \\nT\\nrading Securities\\n \\n273\\nIf a customer wants to purchase 100 shares of ABCD from the dealer \\nin this example, the customer™s markup would be based on the current \\noffering price of 10.05. As a result, the maximum amount the firm could \\ncharge the customer for the stock would be 10.552 per share or $1,055.20 \\nfor the entire order which would include a 5% markup. Notice that the \\nmarkup to the customer did not take into consideration the firm™s actual \\ncost.\\n If a customer wanted to sell 100 shares of ABCD using the previous quote, \\nthe minimum proceeds to the customer would be 9.50 per share or $950 for \\nentire order, which would include a 5% markdown.\\nTo determine the maximum or minimum prices for a customer, use the \\nfollowing:\\n\\n \\n1\\n05% of the o˛er price for customers who are purchasing the security\\n\\n \\n9\\n5% of the bid price for customers who are selling the security\\nWhen determining the amount of the markup or markdown, the follow\\n-\\ning are excluded:\\n\\n \\nF\\nirm™s actual cost\\n\\n \\nF\\nirm™s quote if they are a market maker in the security\\nRISKLESS PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS\\nIf a brokerage ˜rm receives a customer order to buy or sell a security and the \\n˜rm does not have an inventory position in the security, the ˜rm still may elect \\nto execute the order on a principal basis. If the ˜rm elects to execute the order \\non a principal basis, this is known as a riskless principal transaction. Because \\nthe dealer is only taking a position in the security to ˜ll the customer™s order, \\nthe dealer is not taking on any risk. As a result, the markup or markdown \\non riskless transactions will be based on the dealer™s actual cost, not on the \\ninside market. Let™s look at an example:\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nBid\\n \\nA\\nsk\\n10.00\\n \\n10.05\\nA customer wants to purchase 100 shares of ABCD from the dealer and \\nthe dealer executes the order on a principal basis by purchasing the shares for \\nits own account at $10.02 only to immediately resell the stock to the customer. \\n', '274\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n˚e markup in this case must be based on the dealer™s actual cost of $10.02 \\nand the maximum the dealer could charge the customer would be $10.521 \\nper share or $1,052.10 for the entire order.\\nPROCEEDS TRANSACTIONS\\nIn a proceeds transaction, the customer sells a security and uses the proceeds \\nfrom that sale to purchase another security on the same day. FINRA™s 5% \\npolicy states that a ˜rm may only charge the customer a combined commis\\n-\\nsion or markup and markdown of 5% for both transactions, not 5% on each.\\nARBITRAGE\\nArbitrage is an investment strategy used to take advantage of market inef\\n-\\n˜ciencies and to pro˜t from the price discrepancies that result from those \\nineˆciencies. ˚ere are three types of arbitrage. ˚ey are:\\n1.\\n \\nMa\\nrket arbitrage\\n2.\\n \\nS\\necurity arbitrage\\n3.\\n \\nR\\nisk arbitrage\\nMarket Arbitrage:\\n Securities that trade in more than one market will \\nsometimes be quoted and traded at di˛erent prices.

Securities arbitrage consists of the purchase or sale of one \\nsecurity and the simultaneous purchase or sale of the underlying security.\\nRisk Arbitrage:\\n Risk arbitrage tries to take advantage of the price discrep\\n-\\nancies that come about as a result of a takeover.

The two parties to the \\ncontract are the buyer and the seller. The buyer of the option pays money, \\nknown as the option™s premium, to the seller. For this premium, the buyer \\nobtains a right to buy or sell the stock depending on what type of option is \\ninvolved in the transaction. The seller, because they received the premium \\nfrom the buyer, now has an obligation to perform under that contract. \\nDepending on the option involved, the seller may have an obligation to \\nbuy or sell the stock. Series 65 candidates can expect to see a number of \\nquestions on options. Most of these questions will be on equity options.\\nOPTION CLASSIFICATION\\nOptions are classi˜ed as to their type, class, and series. ˚ere are two types \\nof options:\\n1.\\n \\nC\\nalls\\n2.\\n \\nP\\nuts\\nCALL OPTIONS\\nA call option gives the buyer the right to buy or to ﬁcallﬂ the stock from the \\noption seller at a speci˜c price for a certain period of time. ˚e sale of a call \\n', '280\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\noption obligates the seller to deliver or sell that stock to the buyer at that \\nspeci˜c price for a certain period of time.\\nPUT OPTIONS\\nA put option gives the buyer the right to sell or to ﬁputﬂ the stock to the \\nseller at a speci˜c price for a certain period of time. ˚e sale of a put option \\nobligates the seller to buy the stock from the buyer at that speci˜c price for \\na certain period of time.\\nOPTION CLASSES\\nAn option class consists of all options of the same type for the same underly\\n-\\ning stock.\\nFor example, all XYZ calls would be one class of options and all XYZ puts \\nwould be another class of option.\\nClass 1\\nClass 2\\nXYZ June 50 calls\\nXYZ June 50 puts\\nXYZ June 55 calls\\nXYZ June 55 puts\\nXYZ July 50 calls\\nXYZ July 50 puts\\nXYZ July 55 calls\\nXYZ July 55 puts\\nXYZ August 50 calls\\nXYZ August 50 puts\\nOPTION SERIES\\nAn option series is the most speci˜c classi˜cation of options and consists of \\nonly options of the same class with the same exercise price and expiration \\nmonth. For example, all XYZ June 50 calls would be one series of options \\nand all XYZ June 55 calls would be another series of options.\\nBULLISH VS. BEARISH\\nOption investors will seek to establish positions based on their market atti\\n-\\ntude. Option investors are either bullish or bearish.\\n', 'CHAPTER 11\\n \\nOptions\\n \\n281\\nBULLISH\\nInvestors who believe that a stock price will increase over time are said to be \\nbullish. Investors who buy calls are bullish on the underlying stock. ˚at is, they \\nbelieve that the stock price will rise and have paid for the right to purchase the \\nstock at a speci˜c price known as the exercise price or strike price. An investor who \\nhas sold puts is also considered to be bullish on the stock. ˚e seller of a put has \\nan obligation to buy the stock and, therefore, believes that the stock price will rise.\\nBEARISH\\nInvestors who believe that a stock price will decline are said to be bearish. ˚e \\nseller of a call has an obligation to sell the stock to the purchaser at a speci˜ed \\nprice and believes that the stock price will fall and is therefore bearish. ˚e buyer \\nof a put wants the price to drop so that they may sell the stock at a higher price to \\nthe seller of the put contract. ˚ey are also considered to be bearish on the stock.\\nCalls\\nPuts\\nBuyers\\nBullish \\n \\nHave right to buy stock; want \\nstock price to rise\\nBearish \\n \\nHave right to sell stock; want \\nstock price to fall\\nSellers\\nBearish \\n \\nHave obligation to sell stock; \\nwant stock price to fall\\nBullish \\n \\nHave obligation to buy stock; \\nwant stock price to rise\\nBuyer vs. Seller\\nBuyer\\nSeller\\nOwner\\nLong\\nKnown as\\nKnown as\\nWriter\\nShort\\nRights\\nHas\\nObligations\\nMaximum speculative pro˜t\\nObjective\\nPremium income\\nWith an opening purchase\\nEnters the contract\\nWith an opening sale\\nExercise \\nWants the option to\\nExpire\\nPOSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR AN OPTION\\nEXERCISED\\nIf the option is exercised, the buyer has elected to exercise their rights to buy \\nor sell the stock depending on the type of option involved. Exercising an \\noption obligates the seller to perform under the contract.\\n', '282\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSOLD\\nMost individual investors will elect to sell their rights to another investor \\nrather than exercise their rights. ˚e investor who buys the option from them \\nwill acquire all the rights of the original purchaser.\\nEXPIRE\\nIf the option expires, the buyer has elected not to exercise their right and the \\nseller of the option is relieved of their obligation to perform.\\nEXERCISE PRICE\\n˚e exercise price is the price at which an option buyer may buy or sell the \\nunderlying stock depending on the type of option involved in the transaction. \\n˚e exercise price is also known as the strike price.\\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ALL OPTIONS\\nAll standardized option contracts are issued and their performance is guar\\n-\\nanteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Standardized options \\ntrade on the exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange and \\nthe American Stock Exchange.\\nAll option contracts are for one round lot of the underlying stock or 100 \\nshares. To determine the amount that an investor either paid or received for \\nthe contract, take the premium and multiply it by 100. If an investor paid $4 \\nfor 1 KLM August 70 call, they paid $400 for the right to buy 100 shares of \\nKLM at $70 per share until August. If another investor paid $2 for 1 JTJ May \\n50 put, they paid $200 for the right to sell 100 shares of JTJ at $50 until May.\\nMANAGING AN OPTION POSITION\\nIn an option trade, both the buyer and seller establish the position with an \\nopening transaction. ˚e buyer has an opening purchase and the seller has \\nan opening sale. To exit the option position, an investor must close out the \\nposition. ˚e buyer of the option may exit their position through:\\n\\n \\nA\\n closing sale\\n\\n \\nE\\nxercising the option\\n\\n \\nA\\nllowing the option to expire\\n', 'CHAPTER 11\\n \\nOptions\\n \\n283\\n˚e seller of an option may exit or close out their position through:\\n\\n \\nA\\n closing purchase\\n\\n \\nH\\naving the option exercised or assigned to them\\n\\n \\nA\\nllowing the option to expire\\nMost individual investors do not exercise their options and will simply buy \\nand sell options in much the same way as they would buy or sell other securities.\\nBUYING CALLS\\nAn investor who purchases a call believes that the underlying stock price \\nwill rise and that they will be able to pro˜t from the price appreciation by \\npurchasing calls. An investor who purchases a call can control the under\\n-\\nlying stock and pro˜t from its appreciation while limiting their loss to the \\namount of the premium paid for the calls. Buying calls allows the investor to \\nmaximize their leverage and they may realize a more signi˜cant percentage \\nreturn based on their investment.

If an XYZ June 40 put is \\ntrading at $4 when XYZ is at $39, the put is in the money by $1 and the rest \\nof the premium or $3 is time value.\\nUSING OPTIONS AS A HEDGE\\nMany investors will use options to hedge a position that they have established \\nin the underlying stock. Options can be used to guard against a loss or to \\nprotect a pro˜t the investor has in a position. Options in this case will operate \\nlike an insurance policy for the investor.\\nLONG STOCK LONG PUTS/MARRIED PUTS\\nAn investor who is long stock and wishes to protect the position from down\\n-\\nside risk will receive the most protection by purchasing a protective put. By \\npurchasing the put, the investor has locked in or set a minimum sale price \\nthat they will receive in the event of the stock™s decline for the life of the put. \\n˚e minimum sale price in this case is equal to the strike price of the put. \\nLong puts can be used with long stock to guard against a loss or to protect an \\nunrealized pro˜t.

An \\ninvestor who owns a straddle is neither bullish nor bearish. Such investors \\nare not concerned with whether the stock moves up or down in price, so long \\nas it moves signi˜cantly.

An investor may sell a straddle just a˝er a \\nperiod of high volatility, with the belief that the stock will now move sideways \\nfor a period of time.\\nFUTURES AND FORWARDS\\nFutures, like options, are a two-party contract. Many future contracts are an \\nagreement for the delivery of a speci˜c amount of a commodity at a speci˜c \\nplace and time. Futures began to trade for commodities such as wheat and \\ngold and over the years have expanded to include ˜nancial futures such as on \\nTreasury securities and, most recently, single stock futures. ˚e speci˜c terms \\nand conditions of the contracts are standardized and set by the exchanges \\non which they trade. ˚e contract amount, delivery date, and type of settle\\n-\\nment vary between the di˛erent futures contracts. Most investors will use \\nfutures as a hedge or to speculate on the value of the underlying commodity \\nor instrument. Forwards are privately negotiated contracts for the purchase \\nand sale of a commodity or ˜nancial instrument. Forwards o˝en are used in \\nthe currency markets by corporations and banks doing business internation\\n-\\nally. If a corporation knows that it needs to make a payment for a purchase \\nin foreign currency three months from now, the corporation can arrange to \\npurchase the currency from a bank the day before the payment is due. ˚e big \\ndrawback with forwards is that there is no secondary market for the contracts.\\nCORRELATION\\nPrices of two investments that move together are said to be correlated. ˚e \\nvalue of a call would move in the same direction as the price of the under\\n-\\nlying stock. If the price of the stock rises, the value of the call will rise. If \\nthe value of the stock falls, the value of the call will also fall. If the prices of \\ntwo investments move together at the same rate, the investments are said \\nto be perfectly correlated. If the prices of two investments move in opposite \\ndirections, the investments are said to be negatively correlated. Examples of \\ninvestments that are negatively correlated would be common stock and a put \\non the common stock. As the price of the stock increases, the value of the \\nput decreases. Alternatively, if the price of the stock falls, the price of the put \\nwill rise. If the price of two investments move independently of one another, \\nthe investments are said to be uncorrelated. For example, the change in the \\nprice of oil futures o˝en will have nothing to do with a change in the price \\nof Treasury bonds or the change in the price of shares of IBM. As such, the \\ninvestments would be considered to be uncorrelated.\\n', '', '303\\n \\nCHAPTER\\n \\n11\\nPretest\\nOPTIONS\\n1.\\n \\nY\\nou sold 10 IBM May 95 puts at 5.70.

An important part of \\nthis chapter will be to know when registration is required and when \\nan exemption is offered to the subject in question.\\nREGISTRATION OF BROKER DEALERS AND AGENTS\\nPrior to conducting business in any state, a broker dealer must be properly \\nregistered or exempt from registration in that state. ˜e ˚rst test when decid\\n-\\ning if the broker dealer must register is determining if the ˚rm has an o˛ce \\nin the state. If the ˚rm maintains an o˛ce within the state, it must register \\nwith that state. An agent must register in their state of residence even if their \\n˚rm is located in another state.\\nEXAMPLE\\n \\nAn agent who lives in New Jersey and who commutes to their o˛ce in New \\nYork must register in both New Jersey and New York.\\nAgents also must register in the states where they sell securities or o˝er to \\nsell securities as well as where they advertise. If the ˚rm does not have an o˛ce \\nin the state, they may or may not be required to register depending on with \\nwhom they do business. If a broker dealer does not have an o˛ce in the state \\n', '328\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nand engages in securities transactions with the general public, then they must \\nregister. If a broker dealer with no o˛ce in the state conducts business exclu\\n-\\nsively with any of the following, they are not required to register in that state:\\n\\n \\nO\\nther broker dealers\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuers of securities\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment companies\\n\\n \\nI\\nnsurance companies\\n\\n \\nB\\nanks\\n\\n \\nS\\navings and loans\\n\\n \\nT\\nrust companies\\n\\n \\nP\\nension plans with more than 100 participants\\n\\n \\nO\\nther ˚nancial institutions\\n\\n \\nI\\nnstitutional buyers\\n\\n \\nE\\nxisting customers with less than 30 days™ temporary residency in the \\nstate (on vacation or business trips)\\nA broker dealer will not be deemed to have a place of business in a state \\nwhere it does not maintain an o˛ce simply by virtue of the fact that the \\n˚rm™s website is accessible from that state as long as the following condi\\n-\\ntions are met:\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne ˚rm™s website clearly states that the ˚rm may only conduct business \\nin states where it is properly registered to do so.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne ˚rm™s website only provides general information about the ˚rm and \\ndoes not provide speci˚c investment advice.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne ˚rm may not respond to Internet inquiries with the intent to solicit \\nbusiness without ˚rst meeting the registration requirements in the state \\nof the prospective customer.\\nAGENT REGISTRATION\\nIt is unlawful for a broker dealer to employ any agent who is not properly \\nregistered under the Uniform Securities Act (USA). When determining if an \\nagent must register, ˚rst look for whom the agent works. If the agent works \\nfor a broker dealer, the agent must register. ˜e only exception is for o˛cers \\nand directors of a broker dealer who have no involvement with customers, \\n', 'CHAPTER 13\\n \\nR\\negistration of Broker Dealers, Investment Advisers, and Agents\\n \\n329\\nsecurities transactions, or supervision. If the agent works for an exempt issuer, \\nthe agent is exempt from registration no matter what security is involved. \\nExempt issuers are:\\n\\n \\nU\\n.S. and municipal governments\\n\\n \\nC\\nanadian federal and municipal governments\\n\\n \\nF\\noreign federal governments recognized by the United States\\n\\n \\nBa\\nnks, savings and loans, and trust companies\\nAn agent is also exempt from registering if they represent an issuer in the \\nsale of an exempt security such as:\\n\\n \\nBa\\nnkers™ acceptances or time dra˙s with less than 270 days to maturity \\nsold in denominations of $50,000 or more\\n\\n \\nI\\nnvestment contracts relating to employee savings, stock purchases, pen\\n-\\nsion plans, or other bene˚t plans as long as no commission is received \\nfor such sales\\nREGISTERING BROKER DEALERS\\nA broker dealer wishing to become registered in a state must ˚rst ˚le an applica\\n-\\ntion with the state securities administrator. ˜e broker dealer must also pay all \\n˚ling fees and sign the consent to service of process. By signing the consent to \\nservice of process, the broker dealer appoints the administrator as their attorney \\nin fact and allows the administrator to receive legal papers for the applicant. Any \\nlegal papers received by the administrator will have the same force and e˝ect \\nas if they were served on the broker dealer. All applications must also include:\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of organization (corporation, partnership)\\n\\n \\nA\\nddress of business\\n\\n \\nD\\nescription of business to be conducted\\n\\n \\nBa\\nckgrounds and quali˚cations of o˛cers and directors\\n\\n \\nD\\nisclosure of any legal actions\\n\\n \\nFi\\nnancial condition\\n˜e ˚rm™s registration will become e˝ective at noon 30 days a˙er the \\ninitial application has been received or at noon 30 days a˙er the administra\\n-\\ntor has received the last piece of required information. Registering a broker \\n', '330\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\ndealer in a state automatically requires that any o˛cers and directors who \\nact in a sales capacity register as agents in that state.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nBroker dealers must always register with the SEC and with states where \\nthey conduct business.\\nFINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS\\nA broker dealer must be able to meet the minimum capital requirements set \\nforth by the state securities administrator. If the broker dealer is unable to \\nmeet this capital requirement, they must post a surety bond to ensure their \\nsolvency. Broker dealers that meet the Securities Exchange Commission™s \\n(SEC) minimum net capital requirements are exempt from USA™s capital and \\nsurety bond requirements. ˜e amount of the bond required by the adminis\\n-\\ntrator for broker dealers who have custody or discretion over client accounts \\nis limited to the amount of capital required by the Securities Exchange Act of \\n1934. No bond may be required of broker dealers whose capital exceeds the \\namount of the bond required by the administrator. ˜e administrator may \\nrequire that an o˛cer or agent of the broker dealer take an exam that may \\nbe oral, written, or both.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nNo state or political subdivision may enact a requirement for registration \\nthat requires a broker dealer to meet a ˜nancial, record keeping, reporting, \\nor custody requirement that goes beyond that required by the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934 or the SEC.\\nBROKER DEALERS ON THE PREMISES \\nOF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\\nAs the ˚nancial services business continues to bring together investments \\nservices with other more traditional banking services, it is more common \\nto see brokerage services o˝ered at retail bank locations. Broker dealers who \\no˝er investment services at bank branches must follow certain guidelines. ˜e \\n', 'CHAPTER 13\\n \\nR\\negistration of Broker Dealers, Investment Advisers, and Agents\\n \\n331\\nsetting in which the broker dealer conducts its business should be separate \\nfrom where the retail banking business is being conducted, if practical. Broker \\ndealers must disclose to the customerŠat or before the time that the customer \\nopens the accountŠthat their deposits are not guaranteed by the FDIC or \\nthe ˚nancial institution and are subject to the loss of principal. ˜ese same \\ndisclosures must also appear in all advertising and sales literature issued by \\nthe broker dealer operating on the location of other ˚nancial institutions. ˜e \\nhost ˚nancial institution must sign an agreement stating that FINRA and the \\nSEC are allowed to have access to any location where the member conducts its \\nbusiness. ˜e member is required to promptly notify the ˚nancial institution \\nif it terminates an associated person for cause.\\nREGISTERING AGENTS\\nMost states require that agents successfully complete the Series 65 exam \\nbefore they may conduct business within their state.

For advisers with custody of a customer™s cash and securities, \\nthe investment adviser must maintain a minimum net capital of $35,000. If \\nthe adviser is unable to meet this requirement, they may post a surety bond. \\nDeposits of cash and securities will alleviate the surety bond requirement. An \\nadviser is considered to have custody if they have their customers™ cash and \\nsecurities held at their ˚rm or if they have full discretion over their customers™ \\naccounts. Full discretion allows the adviser to withdraw cash and securities \\nfrom the customer™s account without consulting the customer. Advisers who \\nhave only limited discretionary authority over customers™ accounts need \\nto maintain a minimum of $10,000 in net capital. An adviser with limited \\ndiscretionary authority may only buy and sell securities for the customer™s \\nbene˚t without consulting the customer. ˜ey may not withdraw or deposit \\ncash or securities without the customer™s consent. If a state registered invest\\n-\\nment adviser meets the capital requirements in the home state, then he or \\nshe will be deemed to have met the capital requirements in any other state \\nin which the adviser wishes to register, even if the other states have higher \\nnet capital or bonding requirements. Should a state registered adviser™s net \\ncapital fall below the minimum requirement, the adviser must notify the state \\nadministrator of the adviser™s net worth by the close of the next business day. \\n˜e adviser then must ˚le a ˚nancial disclosure report with the administra\\n-\\ntor by the end of the next business day. If the adviser has fallen below the net \\nworth requirement the adviser will be required to post a bond to cover any \\ncapital de˚ciency. ˜e amount of the bond will be rounded up to the nearest \\n$5,000.

If the investment adviser is going to execute an agency \\ncross transaction, he or she must get the advisory client™s authorization in \\nwriting. ˜e authorization may be pulled at any time verbally and the adviser \\nmay not have solicited both sides of the trade. ˜e investment adviser still \\nmaintains a duty to obtain the best execution for both clients and may not \\nexecute the cross at a price that favors one client over the other. ˜e adviser \\nmust send notice to all clients annually detailing the number of all agency \\ncross transactions completed by the adviser.\\nDISCLOSURES BY AN INVESTMENT ADVISER\\nAn investment adviser must update form ADV annually within 90 days of \\nthe ˚scal year end.

If the adviser is a corpora\\n-\\ntion and one of the ˚rm™s major stockholders sells, pledges, or assigns their \\nblock of controlling voting shares, this would be seen as both material and \\nas an assignment of the contract and must be disclosed promptly. If the \\nnature of the transfer is deemed to be an assignment, the client would also \\nhave to give their consent to continue the relationship. A person is deemed \\nto control the investment adviser if they own 25% or more of the adviser™s \\noutstanding stock, have contributed 25% or more of the adviser™s capital or \\nare entitled to receive 25% or more of the adviser™s assets upon dissolution. \\nHowever, if an o˛cer of the corporation leaves, no disclosure is required. If \\nthe advisory ˚rm is organized as a partnership and a major partner dies or \\ndeparts from the partnership, this would be considered material and as an \\nassignment. ˜erefore, the material change must be disclosed promptly and \\nthe client must give consent to continue the advisory relationship.

All securities that are sold to state residents must either be:\\n\\n \\nP\\nroperly registered;\\nor\\n\\n \\nE\\nxempt from registration;\\nor\\n\\n \\nS\\nold through an exemption transaction.\\nEXEMPT SECURITIES\\nExempt securities are exempt from the registration requirements of the Secu\\n-\\nrities Act of 1933. Exempt securities are not exempt from the antifraud provi\\n-\\nsions of the USA. Exempt securities are:\\n\\n \\nI\\nssued by exempt issuers, such as governments\\n\\n \\nS\\nhort-term debt instruments with less than 270 days to maturity\\n', '354\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSECURITIES REGISTRATION\\nNonexempt securities become federally registered by submitting a registra\\n-\\ntion statement to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Nonexempt \\nsecurities also must register in the states in which the securities will be sold. \\n˜e three methods of registering securities in a state are:\\n1.\\n \\nC\\noordination\\n2.\\n \\nN\\notice ˚ling\\n3.\\n \\nQ\\nuali˚cation\\nIt is important to understand how the three types of securities registra\\n-\\ntion di˛er and under what circumstances the di˛erent registration methods \\nare used.\\nREGISTRATION OF IPOs \\nTHROUGH COORDINATION\\nWhen a company ˚rst sells stock to the public during an initial public o˛er\\n-\\ning (IPO), the company must ˚le a registration statement with the SEC. ˜e \\ncompany also must ˚le documents with the state securities administrator in \\nthe states where the issue will be sold. Most IPOs will register with the state \\nsecurities administrator at the same time that they are registering with the \\nSEC. ˜is process of simultaneous registration is known as coordination. ˜e \\nfollowing must be submitted to the administrator:\\n\\n \\nC\\nopies of the prospectus\\n\\n \\nA\\nny amendments to the prospectus\\n\\n \\nA\\nmount of the securities to be o˛ered within the state\\n\\n \\nL\\nist of other states where the securities will be o˛ered\\n\\n \\nC\\nonsent to service of process\\n\\n \\nO\\nther information as required by the state securities administrator, \\nincluding the corporate bylaws, articles of incorporation, specimen of \\nthe security, and indenture of any kind\\nIf an amendment has been made to the federal registration, it must also \\nbe made to the state registration. A security™s state registration will become \\ne˛ective at the time the federal registration takes e˛ect as long as no stop \\norder has been issued and the documents have been on ˚le with the state \\n', 'CHAPTER 14\\n \\nS\\necurities Registration, Exempt Securities, and Exempt Transactions\\n \\n355\\nfor the minimum number of days (usually 10 to 20 days). It is important to \\nnote that a state registration may not become e˛ective prior to the security™s \\nfederal registration becoming e˛ective.\\nREGISTRATION THROUGH NOTICE FILING\\n˜e National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 withdrew the states™ \\nauthority to require the registration of investment companies registered under \\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940. ˜e states preserved the right to require \\ninvestment companies to ˚le a notice and pay a fee. When the issuer of a \\nsecurity notice ˚les with the state securities administrator, the following \\nmust be submitted:\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuer™s name and address\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of organization\\n\\n \\nD\\nescription of the securities to be o˛ered\\n\\n \\nC\\nopy of the prospectus\\n\\n \\nC\\nopy of documents ˚led with the SEC\\n\\n \\nC\\nonsent to service of process\\n\\n \\nS\\ntate fee\\nEven though the state securities administrator no longer maintains juris\\n-\\ndiction over the registration process of the securities, the administrator still \\nmaintains broad investigative powers over any suspected fraudulent sales \\npractices relating to the securities. ˜e administrator may investigate the \\n˚rms and agents who o˛er the securities for sale to investors within their \\nstate. Notice ˚ling may also be used by other federally covered and federally \\nregistered securities that meet the minimum requirements. ˜e administrator \\nmay require an issuer of a federally covered security trading on an exchange to \\n˚le all information with the SEC and to submit a consent to service of process \\nprior to o˛ering any securities to state residents. A security that is federally \\nregistered and trading on the OTC bulletin board or on the pink sheets may \\nbe federally registered but may not meet the minimum criteria to notice ˚le.\\nREGISTRATION OF NONESTABLISHED ISSUERS/\\nREGISTRATION THROUGH QUALIFICATION\\nSecurities of issuers who do not meet the requirements for registering through \\nnotice ˚ling and that are not an IPO must register through quali˚cation. \\n', '356\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nSecurities of issuers that will be sold only in one state through an intrastate \\no˛ering will also be registered through quali˚cation. Registration through \\nquali˚cation is the most complex method of registration. ˜e issuer must ˚le \\na statement containing all of the information required by the state securities \\nadministrator. It may include:\\n\\n \\nN\\name and address of the issuer\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of organization\\n\\n \\nN\\nature of the issuer™s business\\n\\n \\nD\\nescription of industry\\n\\n \\nD\\nescription of issuer™s assets\\n\\n \\nB\\niographical information on o˝cers and directors including name, \\naddress, compensation, and number of shares owned\\n\\n \\nT\\nype of securities to be o˛ered\\n\\n \\nPr\\nice of securities\\n\\n \\nU\\nnderwriter™s discount\\n\\n \\nI\\nssuer™s capitalization and long-term debt\\n\\n \\nA\\nudited balance sheet dated within four months of ˚ling\\n\\n \\nI\\nncome statements for three years prior to date of balance sheet\\n\\n \\nA\\nmount and use of proceeds\\n\\n \\nC\\nopy of prospectus or o˛ering circular\\n\\n \\nC\\nopy of advertising and sales literature\\n\\n \\nS\\npecimen of security to be o˛ered\\n\\n \\nA\\nny other information requested by the administrator\\n\\n \\nC\\nonsent to service of process\\nA securities registration under quali˚cation becomes e˛ective when the \\nadministrator so orders.\\n˜e following apply to all types of securities registration:\\n\\n \\nR\\negistration is e˛ective for up to one year from the e˛ective date or until \\nall securities have been sold, whichever is longer.\\n\\n \\nS\\ntate securities administrators set ˚ling fees.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne registration statement may be amended a˙er its e˛ective date to \\nincrease the size of the o˛ering as long as the price and underwriter™s \\ncompensation remains unchanged.\\n', 'CHAPTER 14\\n \\nS\\necurities Registration, Exempt Securities, and Exempt Transactions\\n \\n357\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne administrator may not require the issuer to ˚le reports more o˙en \\nthan quarterly.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne administrator may require the issuer to report on the progress of the \\nsale of the securities.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne person who ˚les the registration statement with the state may be \\nthe issuer, a broker dealer, or a large stockholder selling shares as part \\nof the o˛ering.\\nThe following apply to registration though coordination and \\nquali˚cation:\\n\\n \\nS\\ntate securities administrators may require that the proceeds from the \\no˛ering be held in escrow until a certain amount has been sold.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne administrator may require that the securities be sold on a speci˚c \\nsubscription form.\\nEXEMPT SECURITIES/FEDERALLY COVERED EXEMPTION\\n˜e National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 provided federally \\ncovered exemptions for securities that have met the stringent listing require\\n-\\nments of any U.S. stock exchange including the Nasdaq stock exchange.

The state securities administrator may deny, revoke, or suspend \\nthe registration of a security, an agent, or a firm. The administrator \\nmay also revoke an exemption from registration, subpoena and \\ninvestigate any registrant, and amend rules as required. The \\nadministrator™s rules and orders have the same authority as any part \\nof the USA but the administrator™s rules and orders do not become \\npart of the USA. The USA requires the administrator to publish all \\nrules and orders. \\nNORTH AMERICA SECURITIES \\nADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION\\n˜e North America Securities Administrators Association is a body of state \\nregulators each of whom is responsible for administering the provisions of the \\nUniform Securities Act within their state. Together they make up an advisory \\ncommittee that re˚ne and amend the Uniform Securities Act through the \\nadoption of module rules and policy statements. NASAA is also responsible \\nfor creating the content tested on the Series 63, 65, and 66 exams. Among \\n', '370\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nothers some of the more testable concepts relating to NASAA™s model rules \\nand policy statements include the following:\\n\\n \\nP\\nolicy statement detailing dishonest and unethical business practices of \\nbroker dealers and agents\\n\\n \\nP\\nolicy statement relating to dishonest sales practices relating to the sale \\nof investment company products by broker dealers and agents\\n\\n \\nP\\nolicy statement detailing requirements for broker dealers conducting \\nbusiness on the premises of other ˚nancial (banking) institutions\\n\\n \\nM\\nodel Rule covering unethical business practices of investment advisers\\n\\n \\nM\\nodel Rule detailing requirements for investment advisers who maintain \\ncustody of client funds\\nACTIONS BY THE STATE SECURITIES ADMINISTRATOR\\nA state securities administrator may take action to bar, suspend, censure, or \\nrestrict the activities of a registrant if the administrator ˚nds it in the public \\ninterest, and the applicant or registrant does one or more of the following:\\n\\n \\nF\\nails to pay ˚ling fees\\n\\n \\nIs\\n insolvent\\n\\n \\nF\\nails to supervise employees\\n\\n \\nW\\nillfully violates the securities or banking laws of another country or has \\nhad a foreign regulator deny, revoke, or suspend its registration within \\nthe last ˚ve years\\n\\n \\nV\\niolates federal securities or commodities laws\\n\\n \\nH\\nas been convicted of any felony within the last 10 years\\n\\n \\nH\\nas been convicted of a securities-related misdemeanor\\n\\n \\nW\\nillfully violates any provision of the USA\\n\\n \\nF\\niles an incomplete, false, or misleading application for registration\\n\\n \\nH\\nas been temporarily or permanently enjoined from the securities busi\\n-\\nness by a court of law\\n\\n \\nH\\nas been subject to an order by a state securities administrator denying, \\nrevoking, or suspending its registration\\n\\n \\nI\\ns deemed unquali˚ed due to a lack of experience, training, or knowledge\\n\\n \\nE\\nngages in unethical or dishonest business practices\\n', 'CHAPTER 15\\n \\nS\\ntate Securities Administrator: The Uniform Securities Act\\n \\n371\\n˜e administrator deeming it is in the public interest is not enough to \\ntake action. ˜e applicant must have been involved in one or more of the \\nactivities just listed. If the administrator is going to take action against the \\napplicant, it must notify them promptly in writing of their intention and must \\nprovide a hearing for the applicant within 15 days of receiving the request \\nfor a hearing. An administrator may deny an applicant™s registration based \\non lack of knowledge, training, or experience but a lack of experience may \\nnot be the sole basis for the denial of a registration.\\nCANCELATION OF A REGISTRATION\\n˜e administrator may cancel the registration of a broker dealer, investment \\nadviser, or an agent if the registrant or applicant no longer exists, has ceased \\ndoing business, or cannot be located. If, for example, the administrator sends \\na notice to a registrant and the notice is returned to the administrator as \\nundeliverable with no known forwarding address, the administrator would \\nhave reasonable grounds for canceling the registrations. Additionally, an \\nindividual™s registration may be canceled if they have been deemed mentally \\nincompetent by a court of law. ˜e cancelation of a registration by the admin\\n-\\nistrator is not a disciplinary or punitive action, it is more clerical in nature.\\nWITHDRAWAL OF A REGISTRATION\\nA broker dealer, investment adviser, or an agent may request that their reg\\n-\\nistration with the state be withdrawn. ˜e withdrawal will become e˛ec\\n-\\ntive 30 days a˝er the administrator receives the request if no revocation or \\nsuspension proceedings are in process. ˜e administrator has up to one year \\na˝er the withdrawal of an applicant™s registration to take action against the \\napplicant to suspend or revoke their registration.\\nACTIONS AGAINST AN ISSUER OF SECURITIES\\n˜e administrator may deny, revoke, or suspend the registration of a security \\nif it deems it is in the public interest and:\\n\\n \\nA\\nny o˙cer or director has been convicted of a securities crime.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne registration statement is false, misleading, or incomplete.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne security is subject to a court injunction.\\n', '372\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\n\\n \\nPr\\nomoter™s fees or o˛ering expenses are excessive or unreasonable.\\n\\n \\n˜\\ne o˛ering is fraudulent.\\n˜e administrator also may revoke a security™s exemption from regis\\n-\\ntration if it is in the public interest and the exemption was based on a false, \\nmisleading, fraudulent, or unethical practice or statement. An administrator \\nmay, without prior notice, revoke the exempt status of a securities transaction.\\nRULE CHANGES\\nAn administrator may change or amend rules as he or she deems necessary. \\nAll rules enacted by the administrator will have the same force and e˛ect as \\nrules enacted under the USA. An administrator™s order may be appealed to \\nthe court system by any aggrieved party within 60 days. ˜e appeal will not \\nact as a temporary stay to the administrator™s order unless ˚rst so ordered \\na court. A rule enacted by the administrator applies to all registrants in the \\nadministrator™s state.\\nADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS\\nIf the state securities administrator issues an order, that order will be enforced \\nagainst a speci˚c registrant or activity. For example, if a broker dealer was \\nengaging in sales practices that violated the USA, the administrator may issue \\nan order suspending that broker dealer™s registration with the state for 60 days.\\nAn administrator may enter an order against a registered ˚rm agent or \\nsecurity without holding a hearing. ˜is is known as a summary order. A \\nsummary order may be issued in any of the following circumstances:\\n\\n \\nT\\no deny or revoke the exemption from registration of a security or \\ntransaction\\n\\n \\nT\\no postpone or suspend the registration of an agent during an investiga\\n-\\ntion of a potential violation or registration issue pending a ˚nal decision\\n\\n \\nT\\no postpone or suspend the registration of a security during an investiga\\n-\\ntion of a potential violation or registration issue pending a ˚nal decision\\nIf the administrator enters an order on a summary basis the administra\\n-\\ntor must send notice to all parties against whom the order was entered. ˜e \\nnotice must provide the details of the order as well as the reasons for entering \\nthe order. ˜e parties must also be noti˚ed that a hearing will be granted \\n', 'CHAPTER 15\\n \\nS\\ntate Securities Administrator: The Uniform Securities Act\\n \\n373\\nwithin 15 days of receipt of a written request. Once an order becomes ˚nal the \\nadministrator must provide a detail of all facts that lead to the order and the \\nlegal basis for the order. No order entered by the administrator may become \\n˚nal without prior written notice and the opportunity for a hearing. ˜e \\nadministrator™s order may be appealed to the court system within 60ˆdays. \\n˜e appeal will not act as a stay of the order unless a court issues a stay.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nIf the administrator suspends the registration of a ˚rm all of the individu\\n-\\nals who are registered with the ˚rm will have their registrations placed \\nin suspense status. After the term of suspension has been completed all \\nregistrations will be reactivated. If the ˚rm™s registration had been revoked \\nall individuals whose registrations were not revoked would be required to \\n˚nd a new ˚rm to become associated with.\\nA stop order is an administrative order taken against an issuer or security \\nwhich stops the security from being sold in the administrator™s state. If the \\nissuer cures or corrects the de˚ciency or problem with the security the stop \\norder will be li˝ed and the security will be allowed to be sold. A cease and \\ndesist order is an order against a person or ˚rm who is engaging in or about \\nto engage in an activity the administrator deems unacceptable.\\nINTERPRETIVE OPINIONS\\nA person who is actively engaged in the securities business may from time \\nto time seek the opinion of the state securities administrator to ensure that \\nthe business that they are conducting is in line with the rules of the USA as \\namended within the state. In response to the request, the administrator may \\nissue an opinion regarding the activity, issue a no-action letter, or may elect \\nnot to issue an opinion. If the administrator issues an interpretive opinion, \\nthe administrator may change a fee for the interpretation of its rules.\\nADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS\\n˜e state securities administrator will maintain all records relating to the busi\\n-\\nness of the state securities administrator and will make the records available \\nupon request. ˜e administrator will provide certi˚ed copies if speci˚cally \\n', '374\\n \\nWILEY SERIES 65\\n \\nExam R\\neview 2016\\nrequested. ˜e administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the production \\nand delivery of the records. ˜e records to be maintained include:\\n\\n \\nA\\nll applications for broker dealer registration\\n\\n \\nA\\nll applications for investment adviser registration\\n\\n \\nA\\nll applications for agent registration for broker dealers and investment \\nadvisers\\n\\n \\nA\\nll applications for registrations of securities and registration statements\\n\\n \\nA\\nll orders, actions, and interpretive opinions entered\\n\\n \\nA\\nll written claims for exemptions from registration\\n˜e records may be maintained electronically, on micro˚lm, or on any \\nother device the administrator may elect.\\nINVESTIGATIONS\\nA state securities administrator may investigate a broker dealer, a state invest\\n-\\nment adviser, or an agent in any state if they feel that a violation has taken \\nor may take place. ˜e administrator may also subpoena people, books, and \\nrecords in any state and may administer oaths to compel people to testify. \\nAnyone who displays contempt for the administrator™s order is guilty of \\ncontumacy and may be found in contempt of court if the administrator asks \\nthe court to enforce its orders.\\n \\nT\\nAKE\\nNOTE!\\n \\nWhile the administrator may investigate and take action in all of the above \\nsituations, the administrator does not have jurisdiction over activities that \\ntake place exclusively outside of the administrator™s state. \\nCIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES\\nA state securities administrator may issue a cease-and-desist order without a \\nprior hearing or notice. ˜e administrator may appoint a receiver to oversee \\nthe assets of violators and may require them to make restitution. ˜e admin\\n-\\nistrator does not have the power to arrest anyone and must refer the case to \\nthe attorney general or other o˙ce empowered to make arrests.
